## What is Programming, and Why is C++ a Preferred Language?

**Programming**

Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to execute. These instructions, written in a programming language, enable the computer to perform specific tasks.

**Why C++?**

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. It is a powerful, efficient, and widely used programming language because:
- It supports both **procedural** and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.
- It provides **high performance and memory control**.
- It is used in **system software, game development, embedded systems, and high-performance applications**.

## What is a Programming Paradigm, and Why is it Important?

A **programming paradigm** is a fundamental style of programming that dictates how solutions are structured. Some common paradigms are:

- **Imperative Programming**

  - Focuses on **how** to perform tasks by changing the program's state through statements.
  - Example:

    ```cpp
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    ```

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Focuses on using objects and classes to structure programs.

- **Procedural Programming**
  - Breaks down tasks into procedures (functions), emphasizing reusable code.
  - A subset of imperative programming.

- **Functional Programming**

  - Focuses on **what** to do rather than **how** to do it. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
  - Example:

    ```cpp
    auto square = [](int x) { return x * x; };
    std::cout << square(5);  // Output: 25
    ```

- **Declarative Programming**

  - Focuses on **what** needs to be done, not how. It often involves querying data.
  - Example:

    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM students WHERE grade > 90;
    ```

### Why is it Important?
Understanding paradigms helps developers write **better-structured, efficient, and maintainable code**.

## How Does C++ Differ from C?

- **C++** is an extension of **C** that introduces additional features like **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **function overloading**, **templates**, and **exception handling**.
- While **C** is primarily a **procedural** programming language, **C++** supports both **procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms**.

| Feature                | C                             | C++                               |

### Major Enhancements in C++

#### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
C++ introduces **classes and objects**, allowing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

#### 2. **Function Overloading**
C++ allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

#### 3. **Operator Overloading**
C++ allows operators to be overloaded to work with user-defined data types.

#### 4. **Exception Handling**
C++ provides a structured way to handle runtime errors.

## What is the File Structure in a C++ Program?

In C++, the organization of files is crucial for managing and structuring code effectively:

- **Header Files** (`.h` or `.hpp`): These files contain declarations for functions, classes, and other identifiers. `#include<iostream>` includes the standard library for input and output operations. Header files promote code reuse and modularity by allowing shared declarations across multiple source files.

- **Source Files** (`.cpp`): These files contain the definitions of the functions and classes declared in header files. They provide the implementation details and include the necessary header files.

- **Main Function**: The entry point of a C++ program is the `main` function, where the execution of the program begins.

A typical **C++ program file structure** consists of:

1. **Header Files (`.h`)** – Contain function declarations and macros.
2. **Source Files (`.cpp`)** – Contain the actual implementation of functions and classes.
3. **Main File (`main.cpp`)** – The entry point of a C++ program.

## What is the Difference Between Low-Level and High-Level Programming Languages?

Programming languages can be categorized into **low-level** and **high-level** based on their abstraction from machine code.

### **High-Level Languages (Easy to Use)**
Think of **Google Search** – you type a query and get results without knowing how Google works internally.
High-level languages work similarly – they are **easier to read, write, and understand**, abstracting complex hardware details.

### **Low-Level Languages (More Control)**
Imagine opening a computer and manually controlling its parts instead of just using a search engine.
Low-level languages work **closer to machine code**, giving **direct control** over hardware but requiring a deep understanding of how computers work.

| Feature              | Low-Level Languages         | High-Level Languages       |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Abstraction**      | Close to machine code      | More human-readable        |
| **Ease of Use**      | Harder to write & understand | Easier to write & maintain |
| **Performance**      | Very fast (direct hardware control) | Slightly slower due to abstraction |
| **Examples**        | Assembly, C                | C++, Python, Java          |
| **Memory Management** | Manual (direct access)    | Automatic (Garbage Collection) |

#### Examples of Low & High-Level Languages

```assembly
<!-- Low-Level Language (Assembly) -->
MOV AX, 05    ; Move value 5 into register AX
ADD AX, 03    ; Add 3 to AX
```
- Directly tells the processor what to do step-by-step.

```python
# High-Level Language (Python)
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
- Easier to understand and does not require knowledge of computer hardware.

#### Is C++ Low-Level or High-Level?

**C++ is both!**
- It allows direct memory access like low-level languages.
- It provides abstraction & object-oriented features like high-level languages.

- **Low-level languages** are **fast and powerful**, but **harder to write**.
- **High-level languages** are **easier to use**, but **slightly less efficient**.
- **C++ gives you both speed and simplicity!** 🚀

## What are Variables and Comments, and Why are They Used?

### What are Variables?

- A **variable** is a named storage location used to store data.
- Variables can hold different types of data, such as:
    - **int → Whole numbers (e.g., 25)**
    - **float → Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)**
    - **char → Single characters (e.g., 'A')**

- Think of **variables** as **labeled boxes** where you store information.
    - For example, if you have a box labeled `age`, you can store a number inside it to represent someone's age.

```cpp
int age = 25;  // A variable storing an integer value
```

### What are Comments?

- **Comments** are like sticky notes in your code.
- They don't affect how the program runs but help you (or others) understand the code better.

**Why Use Comments?**

- Improve code readability
- Explain complex logic
- Help with debugging

**Types of Comments:**

#### 1. **Single-Line Comment**
- Used for short explanations.

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 10;  // Storing the value 10 in x
```

#### 2. **Multi-Line Comment**
- Used for longer explanations.

```cpp
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
int y = 20;
```

## What is Variable Scope, and How Does it Affect Code Execution?

### What is Variable Scope?

- The **scope** of a variable defines **where it can be accessed** in a program.
- Think of it like a **room**: you can only use the items inside that room.
- Similarly, a variable can only be used within the part of the program where it is declared.

### Types of Variable Scope:

#### 1. **Local Variables**
- Declared **inside a function**.
- Can **only be accessed within** that function.
- Like a **key** that only works in one room.

```cpp
void myFunction() {
    int localVar = 5;  // Local variable
    cout << localVar;  // ✅ Accessible here
}
cout << localVar;  // ❌ ERROR: localVar is not accessible outside
```

#### 2. **Global Variables**
- Declared outside all functions.
- Accessible anywhere in the program.
- Like a master key that opens all rooms.

```cpp
int globalVar = 10;  // Global variable

void myFunction() {
    cout << globalVar;  // ✅ Accessible here
}

int main() {
    myFunction();
    cout << globalVar;  // ✅ Accessible here too
}
```

#### 3. **Block Scope**
- Variables declared inside `{}` only exist within that block.
- Like items inside a drawer—you can’t use them outside.

```cpp
int main() {
    {
        int blockVar = 20;
        cout << blockVar;  // ✅ Accessible here
    }
    cout << blockVar;  // ❌ ERROR: blockVar is out of scope
}
```

#### 4. ** Static Scope**
- Variables declared with static inside a function retain their value between function calls.
- Like a notepad that remembers its last written value.

```cpp
void myFunction() {
    static int count = 0;  // Static variable
    count++;
    cout << count << endl;
}

int main() {
    myFunction();  // Output: 1
    myFunction();  // Output: 2
    myFunction();  // Output: 3
}
```

- **Local variables** → Limited to a function.
- **Global variables** → Accessible throughout the program.
- **Block scope** → Limited to `{}` blocks.
- **Static variables** → Remember their value between function calls.

- **Use global variables sparingly!** They make debugging harder.

## What are Data Types in C++, and How Are They Classified?

Data types define the kind of data a variable can store. In C++, they are classified into three main groups:

### 1. **Built-in Data Types**
These are the basic types provided by C++.

- `int` → Stores whole numbers (e.g., `int x = 10;`).
- `float` → Stores decimal numbers (e.g., `float y = 3.14;`).
- `char` → Stores single characters (e.g., `char c = 'A';`).
- `double` → Stores large or precise decimal numbers.
- `bool` → Stores `true` or `false` values.

### 2. **User-Defined Data Types**
These allow creating custom data types.

- `struct` → Groups different types together (e.g., name, age, address).
- `union` → Stores different data types, but only one at a time.
- `enum` → Defines named values (e.g., days of the week).

### 3. **Derived Data Types**
These are based on built-in types.

- `array` → Collection of same-type values (e.g., `int arr[5];`).
- `pointer` → Stores the address of another variable (e.g., `int *ptr;`).
- `function` → Block of reusable code performing a specific task.

- **Choosing the right data type helps optimize memory and performance!**

## What Are Reserved Keywords in C++, and Why Are They Restricted?

- Reserved keywords are special words with predefined meanings in C++.
- They **cannot** be used as variable names, function names, or other identifiers because they serve specific purposes in the language.

### Why Are They Restricted?
- They have a **predefined** role in the language.
- Using them incorrectly can **cause errors**.
- They help define variables, control flow, and manage functions.

| Category  | Keywords |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Types** | `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `void` |
| **Control Flow** | `if`, `else`, `switch`, `case`, `default` |
| **Loops** | `for`, `while`, `do` |
| **Functions** | `return`, `void` |
| **Class & Struct** | `class`, `struct`, `public`, `private`, `protected` |
| **Operators** | `<<` (insertion operator -> used for output in streams (like printing to the screen)), `>>` (extraction operator -> used for input in streams (like reading input from the user)) |

- **❌ You cannot use reserved keywords as variable or function names.**
```cpp
  int return = 5; // ❌ Error: "return" is a reserved keyword.
```

- **✅ Use descriptive names instead**
```cpp
int result = 5; // ✅ Correct usage.
```

- Understanding reserved keywords helps in writing error-free and efficient code!

## What are Operators and Their Different Types?

**Operators** are symbols that perform operations on variables and values, such as calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.

### **Different types of operators:**

#### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   These are used for basic mathematical operations.

- `+` : Addition (e.g., `a + b` adds `a` and `b`)
- `-` : Subtraction (e.g., `a - b` subtracts `b` from `a`)
- `*` : Multiplication (e.g., `a * b` multiplies `a` by `b`)
- `/` : Division (e.g., `a / b` divides `a` by `b`)
- `%` : Modulus (e.g., `a % b` gives the remainder of `a` divided by `b`)
- `++` : Increment (e.g., `a++` increases `a` by 1)
- `--` : Decrement (e.g., `a--` decreases `a` by 1)

#### 2. **Assignment Operators**:
   These operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=` : Basic assignment (e.g., `a = 10` assigns `10` to `a`)
- `+=` : Add and assign (e.g., `a += 5` is equivalent to `a = a + 5`)
- `-=` : Subtract and assign (e.g., `a -= 3` is equivalent to `a = a - 3`)
- `*=` : Multiply and assign (e.g., `a *= 2` is equivalent to `a = a * 2`)
- `/=` : Divide and assign (e.g., `a /= 4` is equivalent to `a = a / 4`)
- `%=` : Modulus and assign (e.g., `a %= 3` is equivalent to `a = a % 3`)

#### 3. **Comparison Operators**:
   These operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result.

- `==` : Equal to (e.g., `a == b` checks if `a` is equal to `b`)
- `!=` : Not equal to (e.g., `a != b` checks if `a` is not equal to `b`)
- `>` : Greater than (e.g., `a > b` checks if `a` is greater than `b`)
- `<` : Less than (e.g., `a < b` checks if `a` is less than `b`)
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to (e.g., `a >= b` checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`)
- `<=` : Less than or equal to (e.g., `a <= b` checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`)

#### 4. **Logical Operators**:
   These operators are used to combine or invert boolean expressions.

- `&&` : Logical AND (e.g., `(a == b) && (a > c)` is true if both conditions are true)
- `||` : Logical OR (e.g., `(a == b) || (a > c)` is true if at least one condition is true)
- `!` : Logical NOT (e.g., `!(a == b)` is true if the condition is false)

## What is the Difference Between `float`, `double`, and `long double` Literals?

**`float`**:

- **Precision**: Holds single-precision floating-point numbers.
- **Memory**: Typically takes up 4 bytes.
- **Use case**: Ideal for storing numbers that do not require high precision.

```cpp
float x = 3.14f; // `3.14f` is a `float` literal (the `f` suffix indicates it's a `float`).
```

**`double`**:

- **Precision**: Holds double-precision floating-point numbers, providing more accuracy than `float`.
- **Memory**: Typically takes up 8 bytes.
- **Use case**: Best for calculations requiring higher precision.

```cpp
double b = 2.718; // 2.718` is a `double` literal (by default, floating-point literals like `3.14` are treated as `double`).
```
`

**`long double`**:

- **Precision**: Holds extended-precision floating-point numbers, offering even more precision and a larger range than `double`.
- **Memory**: Typically uses 12 or 16 bytes, depending on the system.
- **Use case**: Useful for high-precision calculations, especially in scientific computations.

```cpp
long double c = 3.141592653L; // `3.141592653L` (the `L` suffix indicates a `long double`).
```

## What is Typecasting?

**Typecasting** is the process of **converting** a variable from one data type to another. This is useful when:
- Performing operations that require **specific data types**.
- Ensuring **compatibility** between different data types.

### Types of Typecasting
- **Implicit Typecasting (Automatic Conversion)** – Performed by the **compiler** automatically.
- **Explicit Typecasting (Manual Conversion)** – Done using the **(type) operator**.

### Methods of Typecasting
- **C-style cast** → `(float)a` (Converts `a` to a `float`)
- **Functional cast** → `float(a)` (Another way to convert `a` to `float`)

```cpp
int main() {
    int a = 10;
    double b = a;  // Implicit conversion

    double c = 3.14;
    int d = (int)c;  // Explicit conversion

    cout << "Implicit: " << b << endl;
    cout << "Explicit: " << d << endl;
}
```

### Why Use Typecasting?
- Avoids data loss when converting between types.
- Allows mixed-type operations.
- Ensures precision in calculations.

## How Do You Use the Scope Resolution Operator?

The **scope resolution operator (`::`)** helps access **global** variables, functions, or namespace members when there's a **naming conflict** with local variables or class members.

### When to Use `::`?
- **Access Global Variables** → When a local variable has the **same name**.
- **Define Class Functions Outside the Class** → Helps in organizing code.
- **Access Namespace Members** → Avoids **naming conflicts**.

```cpp
int value = 10; // Global variable

class Example {
public:
    int value; // Local variable

    void show() {
        cout << "Local value: " << value << endl;
        cout << "Global value: " << ::value << endl; // Access global variable
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj;
    obj.show();
}
```

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    void show(); // Function declaration
};

// Function definition outside the class using `::`
void Car::show() {
    cout << "Car is running!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.show();
}
```

```cpp
// Define two namespaces with the same function name
namespace English {
    void greet() {
        std::cout << "Hello!" << std::endl;
    }
}

namespace French {
    void greet() {
        std::cout << "Bonjour!" << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    English::greet(); // Calls English version
    French::greet();  // Calls French version
}
```

## What are Constants, Manipulators, and Operator Precedence?

### 1. **Constants**
  Constants are unchangeable; once a constant variable is initialized in a program, its value cannot be changed afterwards.

  ```cpp
  const int MAX = 100;
  // MAX = 200; // This would cause a compile-time error because MAX is a constant
  ```

### 2. **Manipulators**
  Manipulators are used for formatting output:

  - `endl`: Moves to the next line.
  - `setw`: Specifies the width of the output.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include <iomanip>  // For setw
  int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello";
  std::cout << std::endl; // Moves to the next line
  std::cout << std::setw(10) << 123 << std::endl; // Sets width for output
  }
  ```

### 3. **Operator Precedence & Operator Associativity**

**Operators** in C++ follow a specific **order of execution** when evaluating expressions.
- Understanding **operator precedence** and **associativity** helps prevent unexpected results in calculations.

#### 1. **Operator Precedence**

- Determines **which operator** is evaluated first in an expression.

In `int result = a * b + c;`, multiplication (`*`) has **higher precedence** than addition (`+`).

```cpp
int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;
    int result = a * b + c; // Multiplication happens first: (5 * 10) + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
}
```

#### 2. **Operator Associativity**

**Defines how operators of the same precedence are evaluated in an expression.

#### Types of Associativity:

##### **Left-to-right → Most operators (like +, -, *, /) follow this rule.**

- `Left-to-right Associativity` Subtraction (-) is left associative, so a - b - c is evaluated as (a - b) - c.

```cpp
int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 5, c = 3;
    int result = a - b - c; // Evaluated as (10 - 5) - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
}
```

##### **Right-to-left → Assignment (=) and some unary operators follow this rule.**

- Assignment (=) is right associative, so a = b = c is evaluated as a = (b = c).

```cpp
int main() {
    int a, b, c = 10;
    a = b = c;  // Evaluated as b = c first, then a = b
    cout << "a: " << a << ", b: " << b << ", c: " << c << endl;
}
```

## What are Control Structures?

Control structures **manage the flow of execution** within a program.
- They allow decision-making, looping, and altering the normal flow of execution.

### 1. **Sequence Structure**

Executes instructions **sequentially**, one after another.

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int sum = a + b;
cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
```

### 2. **Selection Structure**

Controls the flow of execution based on conditions.

- Implemented using if-else statements or switch-case statements.

```cpp
int a = 5;
if (a > 0) {
std::cout << "Positive number" << std::endl;
} else {
std::cout << "Non-positive number" << std::endl;
}
```

```cpp
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        std::cout << "Monday" << std::endl;
        break;
    case 2:
        std::cout << "Tuesday" << std::endl;
        break;
    default:
        std::cout << "Weekend" << std::endl;
}
```

### 3. **Iteration Statements (Loops)**

Repeats a block of code until a condition becomes false.

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
    i++;
}
```

### 4. **Jump Statements**

Alters the normal flow of execution.

#### Break Statement

-  Exits the loop.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) break;
    cout << i << endl;
}
// Output: 0 1 2
```

#### Continue Statement

- Skips the current iteration.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) continue;
    cout << i << endl;
}
// Output: 0 1 2 4
```

####  Return Statement

- Exits from the function.

```cpp
void greet() {
    cout << "Hello!" << endl;
    return; // Function ends here
}
```

#### Goto Statement

- Jumps to a labeled statement. (Not recommended in modern C++)

```cpp
int i = 0;
start:
cout << i << endl;
i++;
if (i < 3) goto start; // Jumps back to "start"
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What are the differences between for, while, and do-while loops?

### 1. **For Loop**

- Ideal for situations where the number of iterations is known beforehand.

  ```cpp
  for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
      // code to be executed
  }
  ```

### 2. **While Loop**

- Useful when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition being met.

  ```cpp
  while (condition) {
      // code to be executed
  }
  ```

### 3. **Do-While Loop**

- Similar to the while loop, but the condition is evaluated after the code block executes, ensuring that the loop body is executed at least once.

  ```cpp
  do {
      // code to be executed
  } while (condition);
  ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is the difference between the break and continue statements?

### 1. **Break Statement**

- Terminates the loop entirely.

  ```cpp
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i == 5) {
          break; // Exits the loop when i is 5
      }
      std::cout << i << " ";
  }
  ```

### 2. **Continue Statement**

- Skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration.

  ```cpp
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i == 5) {
          continue; // Skips the rest of the loop body when i is 5
      }
      cout << i << " ";
  }
  ```

## What is a pointer and how is it used?

A pointer is a data type that holds the address of another data type. The `&` operator is called the "address of" operator, and the `*` operator is called the "dereference" operator.


```cpp
// Define a variable and a pointer to it
int a = 3;
int* b = &a; // Pointer b holds the address of a

// Display the address and value of a using pointer b
std::cout << "The address of a is " << &a << std::endl;
std::cout << "The address of a is " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "The value at address b is " << *b << std::endl;
```

**Benefits:**

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation

Pointers are used to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically.

```cpp
void dynamicMemoryAllocation() {
    int* ptr = new int; // Allocating memory dynamically
    *ptr = 42;          // Assigning a value
    cout << "Dynamic Memory Allocation: " << *ptr << endl;
    delete ptr;         // Deallocating memory
}
```

2. Container Access

Pointers can point to arrays, structs, or other containers, and can pass the address of these containers to functions.

```cpp
void containerAccess(int* arr, int size) {
    std::cout << "Container Access: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        std::cout << *(arr + i) << " "; // Accessing array elements using a pointer
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

3. Return Multiple Values

Pointers can be used to return multiple values from a function.

```cpp
void returnMultipleValues(int a, int b, int* sum, int* product) {
    *sum = a + b;          // Assigning sum to the pointer
    *product = a * b;      // Assigning product to the pointer
}
```

**Pointer to Pointer**

A pointer to pointer is a variable that stores the address of another pointer. In simple terms, it’s a pointer that points to another pointer, which in turn points to a value.

```cpp
int a = 5;          // A normal variable
int* ptr = &a;      // A pointer that stores the address of 'a'
int** ptr2 = &ptr;  // A pointer to pointer, it stores the address of 'ptr'

// Printing the value of 'a' through ptr and ptr2
cout << "Value of a: " << a << endl;      // Direct value of 'a'
cout << "Value of a through ptr: " << *ptr << endl;  // Dereferencing ptr to get 'a'
cout << "Value of a through ptr2: " << **ptr2 << endl; // Dereferencing ptr2 twice to get 'a'
```

## What is the concept of Null Pointer?

### What is a Null Pointer?

- A **null pointer** is a pointer that does not point to any valid memory location.
- It is used to indicate that the pointer is not currently holding any object or address.

- It is assigned the value NULL or nullptr (C++11 onwards).
- Helps in avoiding dangling pointers (pointers pointing to invalid memory).
- Used to check if a pointer is valid before dereferencing it.

```cpp
int* ptr = NULL;  // Null pointer
if (ptr == NULL) {
    cout << "Pointer is NULL!" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "Pointer is not NULL!" << endl;
}
// ptr == NULL means the pointer is empty and does not point to valid memory.
```

### Why use nullptr instead of NULL?

- `NULL` is an integer constant (0), while `nullptr` is a true pointer constant.
- `nullptr` is type-safe, making it a better choice.

```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;  // nullptr is preferred over NULL
```

### Common Use Cases of Null Pointers

#### 1. **Avoid Dangling Pointers**

A dangling pointer occurs when a pointer still holds a memory address of a deleted object.

```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10);
delete ptr;  // Memory is freed
ptr = NULL;  // Avoid dangling pointer
// Setting ptr = NULL; ensures that it doesn’t point to an invalid memory location.
```

#### 2. **Checking for Valid Memory Before Dereferencing**

```cpp
int* ptr = NULL;
if (ptr) {
    cout << *ptr << endl;  // Won't execute if ptr is NULL
} else {
    cout << "Pointer is NULL, cannot dereference!" << endl;
}
```

## What is the concept of Garbage Collection?

### What is Garbage Collection?

- Garbage collection is the **process of reclaiming unused memory** to prevent memory leaks. However, **C++ does not have built-in garbage collection** like Java or Python!
- Instead, programmers must manually manage memory using `new` and `delete`.

### Why is Garbage Collection Important?

Without proper memory management, programs can suffer from:
-  **Memory leaks** (allocated memory is never freed)
-  **Dangling pointers** (pointers referring to deleted memory)
-  **Memory fragmentation** (small unused memory blocks slow down the program)

```cpp
// Example of Memory Leak
void memoryLeak() {
    int* ptr = new int(10);  // Memory allocated on heap
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    // No delete statement -> Memory leak occurs!
}

int main() {
    memoryLeak();
}
```

**Problem:** Memory is allocated with `new`, but never deallocated with `delete`, causing a **memory leak**.

### Manual Garbage Collection in C++

#### 1️. **Free Memory Using `delete`**

```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10);
delete ptr;  // Memory freed
ptr = NULL;  // Avoids dangling pointer
```
- `Always **free dynamically allocated memory** to prevent leaks.`

#### 2️. **Use Smart Pointers (C++11)**

Smart pointers automatically manage memory by deleting unused objects.

##### 1. **Unique Pointer (`std::unique_ptr`)**

- Manages **exclusive ownership** of an object.
- Automatically deletes memory when it goes out of scope.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>  // Required for smart pointers
using namespace std;

int main() {
    unique_ptr<int> ptr = make_unique<int>(20); // No need to use `new` or `delete`
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
}  // `ptr` goes out of scope, memory is automatically freed!
```

##### 2. **Shared Pointer (`std::shared_ptr`)**

- Allows **multiple pointers** to share ownership.
- Deletes memory when the **last reference** is removed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    shared_ptr<int> p1 = make_shared<int>(30);
    shared_ptr<int> p2 = p1; // Both share ownership

    cout << "Value: " << *p1 << endl;
}  // Memory is freed when `p1` and `p2` go out of scope.
```

- **C++ does NOT have automatic garbage collection** – manual memory management is required.
- **Memory leaks occur if allocated memory is not freed using `delete`.**
- **Use smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`) to avoid manual memory management.**
- **Always assign `ptr = NULL;` after `delete` to prevent dangling pointers.**

## What is an Array, and How are Arrays and Pointers Related?

### What is an Array?
An **array** is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
int *ptr = arr;  // Pointer to first element
cout << *(ptr + 1); // Output: 2
```

### Arrays and Pointers

**Array Name as a Pointer:**

- In C++, the name of an array acts as a pointer to the **first element** of the array.
- This means the array name itself holds the **memory address** of the first item in the array.

- `arr` is equivalent to `&arr[0]`.
- `*(arr + i)` is the same as `arr[i]`.

```cpp
int main() {
    int marks[] = {23, 45, 56, 89}; // Array with 4 integers
    int* p = marks; // Pointer to first element

    // Loop through the array using pointer arithmetic
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        cout << *(p + i) << " ";  // Accessing each element using pointer
    }

    cout << endl;

    // Additional pointer arithmetic examples
    cout << *(p++) << endl; // Output first element and move pointer
    cout << *(++p) << endl; // Move pointer first, then output value
    cout << "The value of *p is " << *p << endl;
    cout << "The value of *(p+1) is " << *(p+1) << endl;
    cout << "The value of *(p+2) is " << *(p+2) << endl;
    cout << "The value of *(p+3) is " << *(p+3) << endl;
}
```

## What are Struct, Union, and Enums in C++?

### 1. **Struct**

A **struct** is a user-defined data type in C++ that allows you to group different types of data together. It is similar to an array, but unlike arrays which store data of the same type, a struct can store data of multiple types.

```cpp
struct employee {
    int eId;       // Employee ID
    char favChar;  // Favorite character
    int salary;    // Salary
};

int main() {
    employee Chilli; // Creating an instance of the struct
    // Access struct members
    Chilli.eId = 1;
    Chilli.favChar = 'H';
    Chilli.salary = 50000;
}
```

### 2. **Union**

A `union` is similar to a struct, but it provides better memory management. All members of a union share the same memory location, so only one member can be used at a time.

```cpp
union money {
    int rice;     // Amount of rice
    char car;     // Car type
    float pounds; // Pounds of something
};

int main() {
    money m1;
    m1.rice = 34;  // Assigning value to rice
    cout << m1.rice; // Output the value of rice
}
```

### 3. **Enum**

An `enum` (enumeration) is a user-defined data type that consists of named constants representing integral values. It makes programs more readable and manageable by defining a set of named values.

```cpp
enum Meal {
    breakfast, // 0
    lunch,     // 1
    dinner     // 2
};

int main() {
    Meal m1 = dinner; // Setting enum value
    if (m1 == 2) {
        cout << "The value of dinner is " << dinner << endl; // Output value of dinner
    }
}
```

## What are Function and Function Prototypes in C++?

### 1. **Function**

- A **function** is a block of code that performs a specific task.
- It helps make the code **reusable, modular, and easier to debug**.

```cpp
// Function definition
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = sum(5, 3); // Calling the function
    cout << "Sum is: " << result << endl;
}
```

### 2. **Function Prototypes**

- A **function prototype** is a declaration of a function before defining it.
- It tells the compiler the function's name, return type, and parameters before the actual function implementation.

```cpp
// Function prototype (declaration)
int sum(int a, int b);

// `int sum` → This is the **function signature**, where:
// - `sum` is the **function name**.
// - `int` before `sum` is the **return type**, meaning this function will return an `int` value.

// `(int a, int b)` → This is the **parameter list**, where:
// - `int a` and `int b` are **parameters** (also called **formal parameters**).
// - These define the expected input types when the function is called.


int main() {
    int result = sum(5, 3); // Function call
    cout << "Sum is: " << result << endl;
}

// Function definition
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

- Prototypes must match function definitions
- Prototypes allow calling functions before they are defined

```cpp
int sum(int a, b);   // ❌ Incorrect: Missing type for 'b'
int sum(int, int);   // ✅ Acceptable but less descriptive
```

- Using function prototypes improves code organization and avoids errors when calling functions before they are defined.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What are Actual and Formal Parameters?

### 1. **Formal Parameters**

- **Formal parameters** are the variables declared in a function's definition.
- They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed when calling the function.
- They exist **only inside the function**.

### 2. **Actual Parameters**

- **Actual parameters** are the real values or variables passed to a function when it is called.
- They provide the function with specific data to process.

```cpp
// Function definition with formal parameters 'a' and 'b'
void add(int a, int b) {
    cout << "Sum is: " << a + b << endl; // 'a' and 'b' are formal parameters
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 3;
    add(num1, num2); // num1 and num2 are actual parameters
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What does it mean by Call by Value, Call by Reference, & Call by Pointer?

### 1. **Call by Value**

- A **copy** of the actual parameter is passed to the function.
- Changes made inside the function **do not affect** the original values.

```cpp
int sum(int a, int b){
    int c = a + b;
    return c;
}

// This will not swap a and b
void swap(int a, int b){
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

int main(){
    int x = 4, y = 5;
    cout << "The value of x is " << x << " and the value of y is " << y << endl;
    swap(x, y); // This will not swap x and y
    cout << "The value of x is " << x << " and the value of y is " << y << endl;
}
```

### 2. **Call by Pointer**

- A **memory address **(pointer) of the actual parameters is passed.
- Changes made inside the function affect the original values.

```cpp
// Call by Pointer
void swapPointer(int* a, int* b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 4, y = 5;
    cout << "Before swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
    swapPointer(&x, &y); // Passing memory addresses
    cout << "After swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
}
```

### 3. **Call by Reference**

- A **reference** (alias) to the actual parameter is passed.
- Changes made inside the function affect the original values.

```cpp
// Call by Reference using C++ reference variables
void swapReferenceVar(int &a, int &b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 4, y = 5;
    cout << "Before swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
    swapReferenceVar(x, y); // Call by Reference
    cout << "After swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What are Static Variables & Functions?

### 1. **Static Variable**

A **static variable** is a variable that belongs to the **class** rather than an **instance**. It is shared among all objects of the class, meaning only **one copy** of the variable exists.

- **Shared Across Objects**: A static variable is common to all objects.
- **Declared Inside the Class**: But must be **defined outside** the class.
- **Memory Allocation**: Allocated once, at program start, and deallocated at program end.
- **Access**: Accessed using the **class name** with the `::` scope resolution operator.

```cpp
class Counter {
public:
    static int count; // Static variable declaration

    Counter() {
        count++; // Increment count for each object created
    }

    static int getCount() { // Static function
        return count;
    }
};

// Define and initialize static variable
int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    Counter obj1, obj2, obj3;

    // Access static function using class name
    cout << "Total objects created: " << Counter::getCount() << endl;
}
```

### 2. **What is a Static Function?**

A **static function** is a function that belongs to the **class**, not to any specific object. It can **only access static variables** and **other static functions**.

- ❌ **Cannot access non-static members**.
- ✅ **Does not require an object** to be called.
- ❌ **Cannot use** the `this` pointer.
- ✅ **Can be called using the class name**.

```cpp
class Circle {
    int radius;
    static const float Pi;

public:
    void setRadius(int r) {
        radius = r;
    }

    int getRadius() const {
        return radius;
    }

    // Static function to get Pi value
    static float getPi() {
        return Pi;
    }
};

// Define static constant
const float Circle::Pi = 3.14159;

int main() {
    // Access static function without creating an object
    cout << "Value of Pi: " << Circle::getPi() << endl;
}
```

## What are Inline Functions, Default Arguments, & Constant Arguments?

### 1. **Inline Functions**

**Inline functions** are used to reduce the overhead of function calls. Instead of jumping to the function's memory location, the compiler replaces the function call with the function's actual code at **compile-time**.

**When to Use?**
- Useful for **small functions** to improve execution speed.
- Not recommended for **functions with static variables**, as they may lead to inefficiency.

```cpp
inline int product(int a, int b){
    return a * b;
}

int main(){
    int a = 5, b = 10;
    cout << "The product of " << a << " and " << b << " is " << product(a, b) << endl;
}
```

### 2. **Default Arguments**

**Default arguments** allow functions to be called with fewer parameters than defined. If a value is not provided, the default value is used.

- Default arguments must be specified in the function prototype or definition.
- Default arguments should be placed after all required parameters.

```cpp
float moneyReceived(int currentMoney, float factor = 1.04) {
    return currentMoney * factor;
}

int main() {
    int money = 100000;

    cout << "If you have " << money << " Rs in your bank account, you will receive "
         << moneyReceived(money) << " Rs after 1 year" << endl;

    cout << "For VIP: If you have " << money << " Rs in your bank account, you will receive "
         << moneyReceived(money, 1.1) << " Rs after 1 year" << endl;
}
```

### 3. **Constant Arguments**

- **Constant arguments** prevent a function from modifying the values of the arguments. This ensures data integrity and avoids accidental changes inside the function.

- When passing read-only data to a function.
- When working with pointers to constant values to avoid accidental modification.

```cpp
int strlen(const char *p) {
    int length = 0;
    while (*p != '\0') {
        length++;
        p++;
    }
    return length;
}

int main() {
    const char *str = "Hello, World!";
    cout << "The length of the string is " << strlen(str) << endl;
}
```

## What is Recursion and Recursive Functions?

**Recursion** is a process where a function **calls itself** to solve a problem. A function that does this is known as a **recursive function**.

### Key Components of Recursion:
1. **Base Case**
   - The condition that **stops** recursion.
   - Prevents infinite recursive calls.

2. **Recursive Case**
   - The function **calls itself** with modified arguments.
   - Continues until the base case is met.

```cpp
// Recursive function to calculate factorial
int factorial(int n){
    if (n <= 1){
        return 1; // Base case
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
}

int main(){
    int number = 5;
    cout << "The factorial of " << number << " is " << factorial(number) << endl;
}
```

### How Recursion Works (Step-by-Step)

- For factorial(5), the recursive calls work like this:
```cpp
factorial(5) → 5 * factorial(4)
factorial(4) → 4 * factorial(3)
factorial(3) → 3 * factorial(2)
factorial(2) → 2 * factorial(1)
factorial(1) → 1 (Base Case)
```
- Now, returning back:
```cpp
factorial(2) = 2 * 1 = 2
factorial(3) = 3 * 2 = 6
factorial(4) = 4 * 6 = 24
factorial(5) = 5 * 24 = 120
```

### When to Use Recursion?
- When the problem can be divided into similar subproblems.
- When using loops makes the solution more complex.

❌ Avoid recursion if it causes stack overflow due to excessive function calls.

## What is Function Overloading?

- **Function Overloading** allows multiple functions to have the **same name** but different **parameters** (either in number or type).
- This enables functions to perform similar tasks while accepting different types or numbers of arguments.

### How Does Function Overloading Work?
Function overloading works by **changing:**
1. **Number of parameters**
2. **Type of parameters**
*(Changing only the return type is **not enough** to overload a function!)*

### **Function Overloading Based on Number of Parameters**
```cpp
// Function to add two numbers
int sum(int a, int b) {
    cout << "Using function with 2 parameters" << endl;
    return a + b;
}

// Function to add three numbers
int sum(int a, int b, int c) {
    cout << "Using function with 3 parameters" << endl;
    return a + b + c;
}

int main() {
    cout << sum(10, 20) << endl;    // Calls the function with 2 parameters
    cout << sum(10, 20, 30) << endl; // Calls the function with 3 parameters
}
```

### **Function Overloading Based on Parameter Type**
```cpp
// Function to calculate the square of an integer
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

// Function to calculate the square of a double
double square(double x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Square of 5 (int): " << square(5) << endl;
    cout << "Square of 5.5 (double): " << square(5.5) << endl;
}
```

### ❌ What Does NOT Count as Function Overloading?
**Changing Only the Return Type**
```cpp
int func(int x);  // Function 1
double func(int x);  // ❌ Error: Only return type is different
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Function Overloading** | Same function name, different **number/type of parameters** |
| **Valid Overloading** | ✅ Change in number of parameters or data type |
| **Invalid Overloading** | ❌ Changing only the return type |

## What is OOP?

- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
- It's a **programming paradigm** or way of writing code that uses "objects" to represent real-world things or concepts.
- Each object can have its own data and functions (called methods) that work with that data.
- It is easier to relate real world entities to the OOP.

### **Key OOP Concepts:**
1. **Class** – A blueprint for objects.
2. **Object** – An instance of a class.
3. **Encapsulation** – Restricts direct access to object data, ensuring security or Hiding internal/private details.
4. **Abstraction** –Hides complex details, exposing only essential features.
5. **Inheritance** – Reusing code from parent classes.
6. **Polymorphism** – Enables objects to be treated as instances of a common parent class.

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    void show() { cout << "Brand: " << brand; }
};
int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.show();
}
```

## Why OOP? Purpose of Implementing OOP?

OOP provides several benefits that make software development efficient and maintainable:

- **Modularity** – Breaks programs into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Code Reusability** – Inheritance reduces code duplication.
- **Scalability** – Efficiently builds and extends large systems.
- **Maintainability** – Modular structure simplifies debugging and updates.
- **Real-world Modeling** – Represents real-world entities as objects.
- **Parallel Development** – Teams can work on different objects independently.
- **Data Security** – Encapsulation restricts unnecessary access to data.

**OOP helps write **organized, reusable, and maintainable code**, making it a preferred choice for large-scale software development.**

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## Why is OOP so popular?

OOPs, programming paradigm is considered as a better style of programming. Not only it helps in writing a complex piece of code easily, but it also allows users to handle and maintain them easily as well.

#### **Key Reasons for OOP's Popularity**
- **Modularity** – Breaks programs into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Code Reusability** – **Inheritance** reduces duplication and promotes efficiency.

## What are the Pros and Cons of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a popular paradigm, but like any approach, it has both advantages and drawbacks. Below is a structured comparison:

### Pros of OOP
| **Advantage**         | **Explanation** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Modularity**        | Breaks programs into smaller, manageable parts, making debugging and maintenance easier. |
| **Code Reusability**  | Inheritance allows efficient reuse of existing code, reducing redundancy. |
| **Scalability**       | Easily extendable for larger projects and adaptable to changing requirements. |
| **Maintainability**   | Organized structure makes it easier to debug and update code. |
| **Data Security**     | Encapsulation restricts unauthorized access, ensuring better data protection. |
| **Real-World Modeling** | Represents real-world entities effectively, making software design intuitive. |
| **Parallel Development** | Different modules can be worked on independently, improving team collaboration. |
| **Extensibility**     | Polymorphism allows modifying or extending functionalities without altering existing code. |

### Cons of OOP
| **Disadvantage**        | **Explanation** |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Requires Skilled Programmers** | Developers need a strong understanding of objects, classes, and OOP concepts. |
| **Not Always Suitable** | Might not be the best choice for small-scale or simple problems. |
| **Larger Codebase**   | OOP programs tend to have more lines of code compared to procedural programming. |
| **More Memory Consumption** | Object creation and dynamic features may lead to higher memory usage. |
| **More Planning Required** | The design phase is complex and requires proper planning before implementation. |
| **Slower Execution Speed** | Due to abstraction layers, OOP can be slightly slower than procedural programming. |
| **Documentation Dependency** | Understanding OOP code without proper documentation can be difficult. |
| **Longer Development Time** | Designing classes, relationships, and interactions requires more effort upfront. |

- **OOP is great for large-scale applications** due to its modularity, reusability, and scalability.
- **However, it requires more planning and can be resource-intensive** compared to procedural programming.

OOP remains a widely used paradigm in major programming languages like **C++, Java, and Python**, making it an essential concept for software developers.

**Additional Advantages of OOP:**
- Follows a **bottom-up approach**, making code more structured.
- **Encapsulation** avoids unnecessary data exposure and enhances security.
- OOP **forces extensive design planning**, leading to better architecture and fewer flaws.
- **Breaks down complex problems** into manageable chunks.
- **Enhances productivity** by minimizing complexity and allowing easy redesigns without affecting other functionalities.
- Provides **efficient modeling of real-world entities**, making programming more intuitive.

## What is the Difference Between Object-Oriented Programming vs Structural Programming?

| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**                          | **Structural Programming**                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Follows a bottom-up approach** – Development starts with objects and their interactions. | **Follows a top-down approach** – Development starts with defining functions and procedures. |
| **Supports data hiding** – Uses encapsulation to restrict direct access to data. | **Does not support data hiding** – Data is freely accessible within the program. |
| **Best suited for complex and large-scale applications.** | **Best suited for moderate or small-scale applications.** |
| **Code reusability** – Inheritance and polymorphism reduce redundancy. | **Limited code reusability** – Functions can be reused, but there is no built-in inheritance. |
| **Based on objects and classes** – Emphasizes real-world modeling. | **Based on procedures and functions** – Focuses on breaking a problem into smaller tasks. |
| **Provides better security** – Data is controlled through access modifiers. | **Less secure** – Data is shared across functions, increasing exposure. |
| **Higher abstraction and flexibility** – Uses encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction for better control. | **Less abstraction and flexibility** – Code organization is more rigid and procedural. |
| **Focuses on data and behavior (methods).** | **Focuses on process and step-by-step execution.** |

- **OOP** is ideal for complex, scalable applications with reusable components and better security.
- **Structural Programming** is suitable for simpler applications that require a straightforward, procedural approach.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What is the Difference Between Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

| **Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP)** | **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Centers around functions or procedures. | Centers around objects that bundle data and methods. |
| Data is often global and less secure. | Data is encapsulated within objects, providing better security. |
| Programs are structured as a sequence of steps or procedures. | Programs are structured around objects and classes. |
| Limited reusability of code due to a lack of modularity and encapsulation. | Promotes reusability through mechanisms like inheritance and polymorphism. |
| Less suitable for complex applications. | More suitable for complex applications. |
| Focuses on function calls. | Focuses on message passing between objects. |

**Limitations of OOP:**
- Programs written using OOP tend to be larger than those using procedural programming.
- Requires significant planning and pre-work before implementation.
- Without proper documentation, OOP code can be challenging to understand.
- Object-oriented programs may consume more memory due to dynamic features.
- Not ideal for small, simple problems.
- Development may take longer due to class and object structuring.

## What is a Pure Object-Oriented Language?

A programming language is called a **pure object-oriented language** if it treats everything inside the program as an object. Unlike hybrid OOP languages, pure OOP languages do not support primitive data types (e.g., integers, floats, characters) outside the object model.

A pure OOP language must satisfy the following properties:

- **Encapsulation** – Data hiding through access modifiers.
- **Inheritance** – Ability to derive new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism** – Same interface, different implementations.
- **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionalities.
- **All Predefined Types Are Objects** – No primitive data types exist outside objects.
- **All User-Defined Types Are Objects** – Every custom type must be an object.
- **All Operations Are Performed Through Methods** – Direct access to variables is restricted; all interactions happen through object methods.

### Examples of Pure OOP Languages
- **Smalltalk**
- **Eiffel**
- **Ruby**

Languages like **Java, C++, Python, and C#** are not purely object-oriented because they allow primitive data types like `int`, `char`, and `float` outside the object model.

## What is Struct?

- A struct (structure) is a user-defined data type in C++ that groups related variables under a single name.
- Structs are typically used for lightweight objects that hold data without requiring encapsulation or functionality.
- Unlike classes, struct members are `public` by default.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Person {
    string name;
    int age;
};

int main() {
    Person p1;
    p1.name = "Alice";
    p1.age = 30;
    cout << "Name: " << p1.name << ", Age: " << p1.age << endl;
}
```

## What is a Class and Why Do We Need It in OOP?

- Class is a building block of OOP.
- It is a user defined data type.
- It is a blueprint or recipe for creating objects in object-oriented programming (OOP).
- It contains data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that define the behaviors of objects.

**Why Do We Need It?**
- **Encapsulation:** Bundles data and methods that operate on the data.
- **Reusability:** Once defined, a class can create many instances (objects).
- **Inheritance:** A class can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.
- **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    void introduce() {
        cout << "Hello, my name is " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person p1;
    p1.name = "Bob";
    p1.age = 25;
    p1.introduce();
}
```

## What are Class Attributes & Methods in OOP?

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), **attributes** and **methods** define the characteristics and behavior of an object.

- **Attributes (Member Variables)** - Represent the **state** or properties of an object.
- **Methods** - Functions inside a class that define the **behavior** of an object.

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    // Attributes (Member Variables)
    string model;
    int year;

    // Method (Member Function)
    void display() {
        cout << "Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating an object of Car
    Car car1;
    car1.model = "Tesla Model 3";
    car1.year = 2023;

    // Calling a method
    car1.display();
}
```

- Attributes store data about an object.
- Methods define what the object can do.
- Methods can access and modify an object's attributes.

## Why Use a Class Instead of a Struct?

In C++, both **classes** and **structs** can be used to create custom data types, but **classes** offer more flexibility and control.

| Feature | **Class** | **Struct** |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Access Control** | Members are `private` by default. | Members are `public` by default. |
| **Encapsulation** | Can have private and protected members, restricting access. | No direct access restriction unless explicitly specified. |
| **Functionality** | Supports methods, constructors, destructors, and operator overloading. | Primarily used for grouping related data, lacks complex functionality. |
| **Inheritance** | Supports **inheritance** (base and derived classes). | **Does not support inheritance** in the same way as classes. |

```cpp
class Person {
private:
    string name;
    int age;

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the data members
    Person(string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}

    // Member function to display the details
    void showDetails() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating an object of the class
    Person p1("Charlie", 28);

    // Calling the member function to show details
    p1.showDetails();
}
```

### Why Use a Class Instead of a Struct?

- **Encapsulation** – Restrict access to sensitive data.
- **More Functionality** – Supports methods, constructors, and destructors.
- **Supports Inheritance** – Can extend and modify functionality.
- **Better Code Organization** – Ideal for complex data structures and OOP.

### When to Use Class vs Struct?

#### Use a class when you need:

- Encapsulation (private members)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Functions and behaviors in addition to data

#### Use a struct when you need:
- Simple data storage without complex behavior
- Lightweight objects for performance optimization

- Structs are ideal for small data models, while classes offer a better, scalable approach for Object-Oriented Programming.

## What are the Similarities Between Class and Struct?

- Both **group related data** into a single entity.
- Both can have **member variables** (data members).
- Both can have **member functions** (methods).
- Both support **constructors and destructors**.
- Both allow **operator overloading**.
- Both can define **static members**.
- Both can use **access specifiers** (`public`, `private`, `protected`).

```cpp
// Class Example
class ClassExample {
public:
    int x;
    void show() { cout << "Class x: " << x << endl; }
};

// Struct Example
struct StructExample {
    int y;
    void show() { cout << "Struct y: " << y << endl; }
};

int main() {
    ClassExample obj1;
    obj1.x = 10;
    obj1.show();

    StructExample obj2;
    obj2.y = 20;
    obj2.show();
}
```

## What is the Difference Between Class and Struct?

| Feature         | **Class** | **Struct** |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Default Access** | Members are `private` by default. | Members are `public` by default. |
| **OOP Features** | Fully supports **inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction**. | Does **not** support inheritance. |
| **Functionality** | Can have **constructors, destructors, and member functions**. | Primarily used for **storing data** with limited functionality. |

```cpp
// Class Example
class Person {
private:
    string name;
public:
    Person(string n) : name(n) {}  // Constructor
    void display() { cout << "Name: " << name << endl; } // Method
};

// Struct Example
struct PersonStruct {
    string name;  // Public by default
};

int main() {
    // Using a class
    Person p1("Alice");
    p1.display();

    // Using a struct
    PersonStruct s1;
    s1.name = "Bob";
    cout << "Name: " << s1.name << endl;
}
```

## What is a Object and Why Do We Need It in OOP?

- An **object** is an **instance** of a class.

### 🧐 What Does "Instance" Mean?
- An **instance** is a **real, usable version** of a class.
- Think of a **class** as a **blueprint** and an **object** as the **actual thing created** using that blueprint.

- It represents real-world entities created from a blueprint (class) with properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions). Without objects, a class is just a blueprint and does not hold any actual data.

- Think of a **class** as a **recipe** and an **object** as the actual **dish** made using that recipe. A recipe defines the ingredients and steps, but unless you cook it, the recipe itself is useless!

- **Class = Recipe 📜**
- **Object = Dish 🍛 (Made from the recipe)**

###  Why Do We Need Objects?

Objects are **crucial in OOP** because they:
- **Store Data** → A class is just a **template**; objects bring it to **life** by holding real values.
- **Encapsulate Behavior** → Objects allow actions using their **methods (functions)**.
- **Enable Modularity** → Promote **code reuse**, better organization, and easy debugging.

```cpp
// Class Definition
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    // Method to display car details
    void showDetails() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar; // Creating an object of the Car class

    // Assigning values to object properties
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.speed = 120;

    // Calling the object's method
    myCar.showDetails();
}
```

- A class is just a concept or a template.
- An instance (or object) is a real, created version of that class.
- You must create an object to use the class in practice!

## What is an Array of Objects?

###  What is an Array of Objects?
- An **array of objects** is an array where **each element** is an **instance of a class**.
- Just like an array of integers (`int arr[5]`), we can create an **array of objects** to store multiple instances of a class.

### Why Use an Array of Objects?
- **Efficient Storage & Organization** → Store multiple objects in a single array.
- **Indexed Access** → Access individual objects using their index, just like normal arrays.
- **Better Code Management** → Helps manage related objects without separate variables.

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    void setData(string b, int s) {
        brand = b;
        speed = s;
    }

    void showDetails() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car cars[3]; // ✅ Creating an array of 3 Car objects

    // Assign values to each object in the array
    cars[0].setData("Toyota", 120);
    cars[1].setData("Honda", 130);
    cars[2].setData("BMW", 160);

    // Display details of each car using a loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cout << "Car " << i + 1 << ": ";
        cars[i].showDetails();
    }
}
```

- Objects can be stored in arrays just like primitive data types.
- Indexed access makes it easy to manipulate multiple objects.
- Loops make it efficient to process multiple instances of a class.

## How do you Pass Objects as Function Arguments?

Objects in C++ can be passed to functions in **two ways**:

1. **Pass by Value**: A copy of the object is made, meaning changes inside the function **won’t affect the original object**.
2. **Pass by Reference**: The function receives a reference to the object, meaning it can **directly modify the original object**.

```cpp
class Complex {
    int a;
    int b;

public:
    // Function to set values of a and b
    void setData(int v1, int v2) {
        a = v1;
        b = v2;
    }

    // Function to set object data by summing two other objects
    void setDataBySum(const Complex &o1, const Complex &o2) {
        a = o1.a + o2.a;
        b = o1.b + o2.b;
    }

    // Function to print complex number
    void printNumber() const {
        cout << "Your complex number is " << a << " + " << b << "i" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1, c2, c3;

    c1.setData(1, 2);
    c1.printNumber();

    c2.setData(3, 4);
    c2.printNumber();

    // Passing objects as function arguments
    c3.setDataBySum(c1, c2);
    c3.printNumber();
}
```

- **Pass by Value** creates a copy of the object, meaning changes inside the function do not affect the original object.
- **Pass by Reference** (const &) avoids unnecessary copies and allows direct modification.
- **Function Overloading** can be used to perform different operations on objects.

## What is Pointer to Objects in C++? What are its Purpose and Benefits?

### What is a Pointer to an Object?

In C++, **pointers** are used to store addresses of both **primitive data types** (like `int`, `float`, `double`) and **objects of user-defined classes**.
A **pointer to an object** is a special pointer that stores the **memory address** of an object of a class type.

### Purpose of Pointers to Objects
Pointers to objects are widely used in C++ for the following reasons:

**Dynamic Object Creation**:
- Objects can be created dynamically at runtime using the `new` keyword.
- This allows more flexibility and efficient memory management.

**Indirect Access**:
- Objects can be accessed and manipulated indirectly through pointers.
- Useful when working with dynamically allocated objects or when passing objects to functions.

**Efficient Memory Management**:
- Reduces unnecessary memory allocation and deallocation.
- Helps in optimizing memory usage in large-scale applications.

```cpp
class Complex {
    int real, imaginary;

public:
    void setData(int a, int b) {
        real = a;
        imaginary = b;
    }

    void getData() {
        cout << "The real part is " << real << endl;
        cout << "The imaginary part is " << imaginary << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex *ptr = new Complex;  // Dynamically creating an object

    ptr->setData(1, 54);  // Using -> operator to access members
    ptr->getData();

    delete ptr;  // Free allocated memory
}
```

## How is Memory Allocated for Variables, Functions, Member Functions, and Data Members?

Memory allocation happens at different times depending on the type of variable or function. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. Memory Allocation for Variables

| **Variable Type**         | **When Allocated?**          | **Where Stored?**               | **When Deallocated?**            |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Local Variables**      | When function is called     | **Stack**                      | When function returns           |
| **Global Variables**     | When program starts        | **Data Segment (BSS/Initialized Data)** | When program ends |
| **Static Variables**     | When program starts (First use) | **Data Segment (BSS/Initialized Data)** | When program ends |
| **Dynamic Variables (`new`)** | When `new` is called  | **Heap**                        | When `delete` is called         |

### 2. Memory Allocation for Member Variables in a Class

| **Variable Type**         | **When Allocated?**        | **Where Stored?**            | **When Deallocated?**      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Non-Static Members**   | When an object is created | **Heap/Stack** (depends on object creation) | When object is destroyed |
| **Static Members**       | When program starts (First use) | **Data Segment** | When program ends |

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int x;  // Non-static (allocated per object)
    static int count;  // Static (allocated once for all objects)

    MyClass() { x = 0; }
};

int MyClass::count = 0; // Allocated when the program starts (Data Segment)
```

### 3.Memory Allocation for Functions

| **Function Type**        | **When Allocated?**       | **Where Stored?**    | **When Deallocated?** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Regular Functions**   | When program starts      | **Code Segment**    | Never (Remains throughout execution) |
| **Member Functions**    | When program starts      | **Code Segment**    | Never |
| **Virtual Functions (vtable)** | When the first object of a class is created | **Heap (vtable pointer per object)** | When the last object of class is destroyed |

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {} // Stored in vtable
};

int main() {
    Base obj; // Allocates vtable pointer in Heap
}
```

### 4. Memory Allocation for Objects

| **Object Type**          | **When Allocated?**       | **Where Stored?**    | **When Deallocated?** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Automatic Objects** (`MyClass obj;`) | When function is called | **Stack** | When function returns |
| **Dynamic Objects** (`new MyClass();`) | When `new` is called | **Heap** | When `delete` is called |

```cpp
int main() {
    MyClass obj1;  // Stack allocation (Deallocated when function ends)
    MyClass* obj2 = new MyClass();  // Heap allocation (Must delete manually)
    delete obj2; // Deallocates obj2
}
```

- **Stack** variables exist only inside functions.
- **Heap** memory must be manually deallocated with `delete`.
- **Static variables exist throughout the program's execution.
- **Functions are stored once and never deallocated.
- **Virtual functions use a vtable allocated on the heap.

## What are Access Specifiers in OOP?

Access specifiers control the visibility of members in a class:

- **Public:** Members are accessible from anywhere in the program.
- **Private:** Members are accessible only within the class itself.
- **Protected:** Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

```cpp
class Person {
private:
    string name;

public:
    Person(string n) : name(n) {}

    void displayName() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person p("David");
    p.displayName();  // Accessing public method
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is the Default Access Modifier in a Class?

In C++, the **default access modifier** for members of a **class** is **private**.

- This means that if you do not explicitly specify an access modifier (`public`, `private`, or `protected`), the members of the class will be **private by default**.

However, in a **struct**, the default access modifier is **public**.

```cpp
class MyClass {
    int privateVar; // Default access is private

public:
    int publicVar; // Explicitly declared as public
};

struct MyStruct {
    int publicVar; // Default access is public
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1;
    // obj1.privateVar = 10; // ❌ Error: private member cannot be accessed
    obj1.publicVar = 20;  // ✅ Allowed

    MyStruct obj2;
    obj2.publicVar = 30;  // ✅ Allowed (default access in struct is public)

    cout << "obj1.publicVar: " << obj1.publicVar << endl;
    cout << "obj2.publicVar: " << obj2.publicVar << endl;
}
```

- For **class**, the default access modifier is private.
- For **struct**, the default access modifier is public.
- You must `explicitly` use **public** if you want class members to be accessible outside the class.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is Sealed Modifier?

A **sealed class** or **sealed modifier** is used to prevent other classes from inheriting from it. In some languages like C# or Java, marking a class as sealed ensures that no class can derive from it.

```csharp
sealed class MyClass {
    public void Display() {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a sealed class.");
    }
}

// This will result in a compile-time error:
// class DerivedClass : MyClass { }  // Error: cannot inherit from sealed class
```

- In languages like C++, the equivalent would be to simply avoid inheritance by not defining any child classes, as C++ does not have a direct **sealed** keyword.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What is Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) and the new Keyword? What are Their Purpose and Benefits?

### What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?
Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) in C++ allows memory to be **allocated at runtime**, rather than at compile time. This is done using the `new` keyword, which **allocates memory on the heap** and returns a pointer to the allocated space. The allocated memory must be **freed** using the `delete` operator (or smart pointers) to prevent **memory leaks**.

C++ also provides `new[]` and `delete[]` for dynamically **allocating and deallocating arrays**.

### Purpose
- **Allocates memory on the heap** (instead of the stack).
- **Returns a pointer** to the allocated memory.
- **Allows dynamic object creation** and flexible memory management.

### Benefits of Dynamic Memory Allocation
- **Efficient Memory Usage** – Allocates memory **only when needed**, reducing wastage.
- **Supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Allows creating objects dynamically.
- **Flexible Array Allocation** – Arrays can be allocated dynamically based on user input.
- **Lifetime Control** – Objects persist beyond function calls if necessary.

```cpp
int main() {
    // Allocating memory for a single integer
    int* ptr = new int(10);
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;

    // Allocating memory for an array
    int* arr = new int[5]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    cout << "Array elements: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Freeing the allocated memory
    delete ptr;   // Free single integer
    delete[] arr; // Free array
}
```

- Forgetting to delete dynamically allocated memory results in memory leaks.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is the `delete` What are its Purpose and Benefits?

The `delete` keyword in C++ is used to **free dynamically allocated memory** that was allocated using the `new` keyword. It ensures that memory allocated on the **heap** is properly released and made available for reuse.

### Purpose
- **Releases memory allocated with `new`**, preventing memory leaks.
- Returns the allocated memory back to the **operating system**.
- Improves memory efficiency, ensuring the program doesn't consume excessive resources.

### Benefits
**Prevents Memory Leaks** – Ensures memory allocated using `new` is properly deallocated.
**Efficient Memory Management** – Helps manage heap memory efficiently, especially for large objects and arrays.
**Avoids Unnecessary Memory Consumption** – Frees up memory for reuse.

```cpp
int main() {
    // Dynamically allocate an array of 3 integers
    int* arr = new int[3];

    arr[0] = 10;
    arr[1] = 20;
    arr[2] = 30;

    cout << "Before delete: " << arr[0] << ", " << arr[1] << ", " << arr[2] << endl;

    // Free the allocated memory
    delete[] arr;

    // After deletion, accessing the array leads to undefined behavior
    cout << "After delete (undefined behavior): " << arr[0] << endl;
}
```

## What is the Arrow (`->`) and Dot (`.`) Operator? What is its Purpose or Benefit?

In C++, the **dot (`.`) operator** and **arrow (`->`) operator** are used to access **members (variables or functions)** of classes. They provide a way to interact with **class members** directly or through pointers.

### `.` (Dot Operator)
- **Purpose**: Used to access members of an object **directly**.
- **When to Use?** When you have an **object** (not a pointer).
- **Benefits**: Simple and easy to read.

### `->` (Arrow Operator)
- **Purpose**: Used to access members of an object **through a pointer**.
- **When to Use?** When you have a **pointer to an object**.
- **Benefits**: Allows working with dynamically allocated objects and **supports polymorphism**.

```cpp
class Complex {
    int real, imaginary;

public:
    void getData() {
        cout << "The real part is " << real << endl;
        cout << "The imaginary part is " << imaginary << endl;
    }

    void setData(int a, int b) {
        real = a;
        imaginary = b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex obj;

    obj.setData(1, 54);  // Accessing members using the . operator
    obj.getData();

    Complex *ptr = new Complex;
    ptr->setData(5, 10);  // Accessing members using the -> operator with a pointer
    ptr->getData();

    delete ptr;  // Free allocated memory
}
```

## What Happens When an Object is Created Without `new` vs With `new`? Where is it stored?

### Object Creation Without `new`

When an object is created **without** using `new`, it is allocated on the **stack**.
- The memory is **automatically managed** and released when the function/block scope ends.
- No manual `delete` is required.

```cpp
// Example (Stack Allocation)
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        cout << "Constructor called!" << endl;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        cout << "Destructor called!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // Stack allocation (automatic storage)
    return 0;
} // Object `obj` is destroyed automatically when main() ends.
```

- Stored in the stack section of memory.
- Automatically deallocated when it goes out of scope.

### Object Creation With `new`

When an object is created using new, it is allocated on the **heap (dynamic memory)**.
- The memory remains allocated until manually released using delete.
- The object persists beyond the function scope unless explicitly deleted.

```cpp
// Example (Heap Allocation)
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        cout << "Constructor called!" << endl;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        cout << "Destructor called!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass* obj = new MyClass(); // Heap allocation (dynamic storage)
    delete obj; // Manually releasing memory
}
```

- Stored in the heap section of memory.
- Must be manually deallocated using **delete to avoid memory leaks**.

| Feature                | Stack Allocation (`new` not used) | Heap Allocation (`new` used) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Storage**           | Stack                            | Heap                        |
| **Lifetime**          | Limited to function/block scope | Stays until `delete` is called |
| **Memory Management** | Automatic                        | Manual (`new` / `delete`)  |
| **Performance**       | Faster                           | Slightly slower (due to dynamic allocation) |
| **Risk of Memory Leak** | No                               | Yes (if `delete` is not used) |

## What is Shallow Copy? and What’s the Problem with Shallow Copy?

As we have studied earlier, the C++ compiler provides a default copy constructor and assignment operator. Until now, we have been dealing with data members which were simple variables, but what happens when we deal with pointer or reference variables? Think about it 🤔.

### Shallow Copy

A **shallow copy** is a copy of an object **where only the values of the member variables are copied**, but if there is a pointer in the object, **only the pointer address is copied**, not the actual data.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int* ptr; // Pointer to dynamically allocated memory

    Example(int val) {
        ptr = new int(val); // Allocating memory dynamically
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(10);
    Example obj2 = obj1; // Shallow copy happens here

    obj2.show(); // Shows 10
}
```

- `obj2` is created as a copy of `obj1`.
- Both objects share the same memory for ptr.

### What's the Problem with Shallow Copy? 😒

When one object modifies the dynamically allocated memory, it affects all objects sharing the same memory.

```cpp
// Problem with Shallow Copy
class fraction {
    int* numerator;
    int denominator;

public:
    // Default Constructor
    fraction() {
        numerator = new int(1);
        denominator = 2;
    }

    // Setter
    void setNumerator(int n) {
        *numerator = n;
    }

    void printData() const {
        cout << "Rational number is: " << *numerator << "/" << denominator << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    fraction f1;
    fraction f2(f1); // Memberwise copying by default copy constructor
    fraction f3 = f1; // Memberwise copying by default copy assignment operator

    f3.setNumerator(6);

    // The issue: Changing f3's numerator also affects f1 and f2!
    // Reason: Shallow copy only copies the pointer, not the actual data.
    // All objects share the same memory address for `numerator`.

    f3.printData(); // numerator = 6
    f1.printData(); // numerator = 6
    f2.printData(); // numerator = 6
}lass Example {
public:
    int* ptr;

    Example(int val) {
        ptr = new int(val);
    }

    void setValue(int val) {
        *ptr = val;
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(10);
    Example obj2 = obj1; // Shallow copy: obj2.ptr points to the same memory

    obj2.setValue(20); // Changing obj2 also changes obj1

    obj1.show(); // Output: 20 😲 (unexpected change!)
    obj2.show(); // Output: 20
}
```

### Why is this happening?
- The default copy constructor only copies the pointer's address.
- Both obj1 and obj2 share the same memory.
- Changing obj2 also changes obj1.

### What’s the Solution? 😉

To fix this issue, we need a Deep Copy, where a new memory block is allocated for each object.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is Deep Copy?

A **Deep Copy** is a copying process where a new object is created along with a **separate copy** of dynamically allocated memory. This ensures that modifying one object does **not** affect the other.

- Creates a **new memory allocation** for copied data.
- Prevents **unexpected modifications** between objects.
- Requires **explicit copy constructor** and **overloaded assignment operator**.

In Deep Copy:
- An **entirely new object** is created by copying all variables.
- **New dynamic memory** is allocated for copied values.
- The **copy constructor** and **assignment operator** must be defined explicitly.
- **Destructor** is needed to free allocated memory and **prevent memory leaks**.

### Two Types of Deep Copy:
1️. **Deep Copy in Copy Constructor**
2️. **Deep Copy in Assignment Operator**

```cpp
class Fraction {
    int* numerator;
    int denominator;

public:
    // Default Constructor
    Fraction() {
        numerator = new int(1);
        denominator = 2;
    }

    // Deep Copy using Copy Constructor
    Fraction(const Fraction& tempObj) {
        numerator = new int;
        *numerator = *(tempObj.numerator);
        denominator = tempObj.denominator;
    }

    // Deep Copy using Assignment Operator
    Fraction& operator=(const Fraction& obj) {
        if (this != &obj) { // Self-assignment check
            delete numerator; // Free existing memory to prevent leaks
            numerator = new int;
            *numerator = *(obj.numerator);
            denominator = obj.denominator;
        }
        return *this; // Return current object for cascading
    }

    // Setter
    void setNumerator(int n) {
        *numerator = n;
    }

    // Display Function
    void printData() const {
        cout << "Rational number is: " << *numerator << "/" << denominator << endl;
    }

    // Destructor (To avoid memory leaks)
    ~Fraction() {
        delete numerator;
    }
};

int main() {
    Fraction f1;
    Fraction f2(f1); // Deep copy using Copy Constructor
    Fraction f3 = f1; // Deep copy using Assignment Operator

    f3.setNumerator(6); // Changing f3's numerator should NOT affect f1 or f2

    f3.printData(); // Output: 6/2 ✅
    f1.printData(); // Output: 1/2 ✅ No change in original
    f2.printData(); // Output: 1/2 ✅ No change in copied object
}
```

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int* ptr;

    Example(int val) {
        ptr = new int(val); // Allocate memory dynamically
    }

    // Deep Copy Constructor
    Example(const Example& obj) {
        ptr = new int(*obj.ptr); // Allocate new memory and copy value
    }

    void setValue(int val) {
        *ptr = val;
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    }

    ~Example() {
        delete ptr; // Free allocated memory to prevent leaks
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(10);
    Example obj2 = obj1; // Deep copy occurs here

    obj2.setValue(20); // Changes only obj2

    obj1.show(); // Output: 10 ✅ No unexpected changes
    obj2.show(); // Output: 20 ✅ Independent data
}
```

## What is the Difference Between Shallow and Deep Copy of a Class?

| Feature         | Shallow Copy | Deep Copy  |
|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Memory Allocation** | Copies references to original data | Allocates new memory and copies data |
| **Data Sharing** | Shared between objects | Independent copy for each object |
| **Impact of Changes** | Changes in copied object affect the original | Changes in copied object do not affect the original |
| **Performance** | Faster (only copies references) | Slower (allocates and copies data) |
| **Usage** | Suitable when **sharing** data is intended | Needed when **independent objects** are required |

## Explain the Concept of `static` in OOP, Including Static Data Members and Static Member Functions?

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the `static` keyword is used to define **class-level** members that do not belong to individual objects. Instead, they are shared among all instances of the class.

### Features of `static` in OOP:
- **Shared across objects**: A static member belongs to the class, not to an object.
- **Memory efficiency**: Static members are stored in a single memory location.
- **Access through class name**: Static members can be accessed using the class name without creating an instance.
- **No `this` pointer**: Static member functions do not have access to the `this` pointer.

### **1. Static Data Members**
Static data members are **variables that belong to a class rather than an instance**. They are shared among all objects of the class and maintain a single copy in memory.

#### Characteristics:
- Declared inside the class using the `static` keyword.
- Defined and initialized outside the class using the **scope resolution operator (`::`)**.
- Shared by all objects of the class.
- Must be accessed using the class name (preferred) or an object.

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    static int count; // Static variable
    string eName;

    void setName(string name) {
        eName = name;
        count++; // Increment count for every new employee
    }

    static int getCount() { // Static method
        return count;
    }
};

// Define and initialize static variable
int Employee::count = 0;

int main() {
    Employee emp1, emp2;
    emp1.setName("Alice");
    emp2.setName("Bob");

    // Access static member using class name
    cout << "Total Employees: " << Employee::getCount() << endl;
}
```

### **2. Static Member Functions**

Static member functions belong to the **class** rather than an **object** and can only access **static data members**.

### Rules:
- Cannot access **non-static data members**.
- Cannot use the **`this` pointer**.
- Can be called using the **class name**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Circle {
    int radius;
    static const float Pi;

public:
    void setRadius(int r) {
        radius = r;
    }

    int getRadius() const {
        return radius;
    }

    // Static function to get Pi value
    static float getPi() {
        return Pi;
    }
};

// Define static constant
const float Circle::Pi = 3.14159;

int main() {
    // Access static function without creating an object
    cout << "Value of Pi: " << Circle::getPi() << endl;
}
```

## What are the types of variables in OOP?

In **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**, variables are categorized into different types based on **scope, lifetime, and memory location**.

The main types of variables in **OOP** are:
1. **Instance Variable**
2. **Static Variable**
3. **Local Variable**
4. **Reference Variable**

### **1️. Instance Variable**
- It is an **object-level** variable.
- Declared inside a class but **outside methods, blocks, and constructors**.
- Created when an object is instantiated (`new` keyword).
- Can be accessed using **object reference**.

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    int id;  // Instance Variable

    void setId(int empId) {
        id = empId; // Assign value to instance variable
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Employee ID: " << id << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Employee e1, e2;  // Creating objects
    e1.setId(101);
    e2.setId(102);

    e1.display();
    e2.display();
}
```

### **2. Static Variable**

- It is a **class-level** variable shared among all objects.
- Declared using the `static` keyword.
- **Single memory allocation** for all objects.
- Can be accessed using **ClassName::variable_name**.

```cpp
class Counter {
public:
    static int count; // Static Variable

    Counter() {
        count++; // Increment count for each object
    }

    static void displayCount() {
        cout << "Total Objects Created: " << count << endl;
    }
};

// Initializing static variable
int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    Counter c1, c2, c3;  // Creating three objects
    Counter::displayCount(); // Accessing static variable
}
```

**Explanation:** `count` is a **static variable**, shared among all objects of the `Counter` class.

### **3. Local Variable**

- It is a **method-level** variable.
- Declared **inside a function, block, or constructor**.
- **Only accessible within that function or block**.
- Must be **initialized before use**.

```cpp
class Demo {
public:
    void show() {
        int localVar = 10; // Local Variable
        cout << "Local Variable: " << localVar << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Demo obj;
    obj.show();
    // cout << localVar;  // ❌ Error: localVar is not accessible outside show()
}
```

**Explanation:** `localVar` is a **local variable** inside `show()`, which means it **cannot be accessed outside** this function.

### **4. Reference Variable**

- It is a **variable that points to an object**.
- It stores the **memory address** of another variable or object.
- Used for **efficient memory management** in OOP.

```cpp
class Student {
public:
    string name;
};

int main() {
    Student s1;
    s1.name = "Ahad";

    Student &s2 = s1; // Reference Variable

    cout << "Student 1 Name: " << s1.name << endl;
    cout << "Student 2 (Reference) Name: " << s2.name << endl;

    s2.name = "Ali";  // Changing via reference
    cout << "Updated Student 1 Name: " << s1.name << endl; // Also changes
}
```

**Explanation:** `s2` is a **reference variable** that refers to `s1`. Changing `s2` also modifies `s1` since they refer to the same memory location.

| Variable Type       | Scope          | Memory Location         | Access                                      |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Instance Variable** | **Object-level** | Heap Memory (inside object) | Accessed using `objectName.variableName` |
| **Static Variable**   | **Class-level**  | Static Memory (shared) | Accessed using `ClassName::variableName` |
| **Local Variable**    | **Method/block** | Stack Memory (temporary) | Accessed inside method only |
| **Reference Variable** | **Alias to another variable** | Uses memory of original variable | Accessed like normal variable |

Understanding different types of variables is essential in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
- Use **instance variables** when **each object needs its own data**.
- Use **static variables** when **data needs to be shared among all objects**.
- Use **local variables** for **temporary data** inside functions.
- Use **reference variables** to create **aliases and manage memory efficiently**.

## What is `const` in OOP and How is it Used?

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), `const` is used to define **immutable objects, data members, and member functions** that should not be modified after initialization.

### **1. `const` Data Members**
A **`const` data member** is a variable within a class whose value **cannot be modified** after initialization. It **must be initialized at the time of object creation**.

#### Ways to Declare and Initialize `const` Data Members:
1. **Direct Initialization** (Some compilers do not allow this).
2. **Initializer List in Constructor** (Recommended approach).

```cpp
class Student {
    string name;

    // 1) Initializing const member at time of declaration
    const int Id = 1;
    const double CNIC;

public:
    // 2) Initializing const member in member initializer list
    Student() : CNIC(1234567890123) {} // Correct way
};

int main() {
    Student obj;
}
```

- **Note: You must initialize const data members during object construction.**

### **2. `const` Member Functions**
A `const` member function ensures that no class data members (whether const or non-const) can be modified inside it.

#### Key Rules:
- It only allows memory reading.
- It can be accessed by both const and non-const objects.
- Constructors cannot be const, as they modify object state.

```cpp
class Student {
    string name;
    const int Id = 1;

public:
    // Const member function (Only reading is allowed)
    string getName() const {
        // name = "Ahad"; ❌ Error: Cannot modify data member
        return name;
    }

    int getId() const {
        // Id = 9; ❌ Error: Cannot modify `const` data member
        return Id;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student_1;
    const Student student_2;

    // Accessing `const` function with a non-const object
    student_1.getId();
    // Accessing `const` function with a const object
    student_2.getId();
}
```

### **3. `const` objects**
A `const` object is an instance of a class that only allows memory reading. This means you cannot modify any data members.

#### Key Rules:
- const objects can only call const member functions.
- They cannot call non-const member functions.

```cpp
class Student {
    string name;
    const int Id = 1;

public:
    // Const function
    int getId() const {
        return Id;
    }

    // Non-const function
    string getName() {
        return name;
    }
};

int main() {
    const Student student_1;

    // ✅ Allowed: Calling `const` member function
    student_1.getId();

    // ❌ Error: `const` object cannot call non-`const` function
    // student_1.getName(); // Uncommenting this will cause an error
}
```

## What are friend functions and friend classes in C++? How are they used?

In C++, **friend functions** and **friend classes** allow access to private and protected members of a class, even though they are not part of the class.

- **Friend Function** → A non-member function that has access to private/protected data of a class.
- **Friend Class** → A class that has access to another class's private/protected members.

### **Friend Functions**

A **friend function** is a function that is **not a member** of a class but can still access the class’s **private and protected** members.

#### Properties:
- **Not a Member** → Defined outside the class.
- **Declared Inside the Class** → Declared using the `friend` keyword inside the class.
- **Can Access Private Members** → Can directly access private/protected members of the class.

```cpp
class Box {
private:
    int length;

public:
    Box() : length(0) {}  // Constructor initializes length to 0
    void setLength(int l) { length = l; }

    // Friend function declaration
    friend void printLength(const Box& b);
};

// Friend function definition
void printLength(const Box& b) {
    cout << "Length of the box is: " << b.length << endl;
}

int main() {
    Box b;
    b.setLength(10);
    printLength(b); // Calling friend function
}
```

### **Friend Classes**

A **friend class** is a class that has **full access** to the private and protected members of another class.

#### Properties:
- **Grants Access to Another Class** → A class can access another class's private/protected members.
- **Defined Using `friend` Keyword** → The target class is declared as a `friend` inside the first class.
- **Useful for Closely Related Classes** → Used when two classes need to work together and share private data.

```cpp
class ClassB; // Forward declaration

class ClassA {
public:
    void showClassBDetails(const ClassB& b); // Function accessing ClassB's private members
};

class ClassB {
private:
    int secret;

public:
    ClassB() : secret(42) {}  // Constructor initializes secret

    // Declaring ClassA as a friend
    friend class ClassA;
};

// Member function of ClassA accessing ClassB’s private member
void ClassA::showClassBDetails(const ClassB& b) {
    cout << "ClassB's secret is: " << b.secret << endl;
}

int main() {
    ClassB b;
    ClassA a;
    a.showClassBDetails(b); // Accessing ClassB's private data
}
```

#### When to Use Friend Functions & Friend Classes?

| Feature      | Friend Function                                      | Friend Class                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Access**   | Specific function                                    | Whole class                                      |
| **Use Case** | Used for utility functions that operate on private data | Used when two classes need deep integration     |
| **Example**  | A function that needs access to a class’s private data | A class that manages another class’s private members |


**Friend Functions**: Grant a **single function** access to private data.
**Friend Classes**: Grant an **entire class** access to another class’s private data.
**Use with Caution!** 🚨 Overusing friend functions/classes can break **encapsulation**.

## What are Member Functions, Its Purpose and Nesting of Member Function in OOP?

### **What are Member Functions?**
Member functions are **functions declared inside a class** that operate on its objects. They have access to **private and protected data members** of the class.

#### **Purpose of Member Functions**
- **Encapsulation** – Bundles data and functions together.
- **Code Reusability** – Provides modular and reusable code.
- **Data Abstraction** – Controls data access.
- **Object Manipulation** – Modifies object states.

### **Nesting of Member Functions**
Nesting of member functions means **calling one member function inside another** within the same class.

```cpp
class Demo {
    int num;

public:
    void input() {
        cout << "Enter a number: ";
        cin >> num;
    }

    void display() {
        input();  // Calling input() inside display()
        cout << "You entered: " << num << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Demo obj;
    obj.display();  // Calling display() triggers input()
}
```

## What is `this` pointer in OOP and its purpose?

### **What is `this` Pointer?**
- In **C++**, `this` is a **pointer** that represents the **current instance** of a class.
- It is **implicitly passed** as a hidden argument to all **non-static** member function calls.

### **Purpose of `this` Pointer**
- **Identifying Object Context** – Distinguishes between **local variables and instance variables** when they have the same name.
- **Accessing Object's Members** – Enables accessing **member variables and methods** of the current object within its own scope.
- **Returning References** – Can be used to return a **reference to the current object**, enabling **method chaining** and fluent interfaces.

```cpp
class A {
    int a;

public:
    void setData(int a) {
        this->a = a;  // Using 'this' to access member variable 'a'
    }

    void getData() {
        cout << "The value of a is " << a << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    A obj;
    obj.setData(5);
    obj.getData();
}
```

- The `this` pointer refers to the **current object** inside the class.
- It helps to differentiate between **local and instance variables**.

- Its scope is **Current Object Context**, created inside **Stack Memory**, and accessed inside **non-static methods**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What is a constructor, and what are its rules and types?

A **constructor** is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created.
- It has the same name as the class and is primarily used to initialize objects.
- It **does not return** any value (not even `void`).
- If no constructor is defined, C++ provides a **default constructor**.

### What are the Rules for Creating a Constructor?

- It **must have the same name** as the class.
- It **cannot have a return type** (not even `void`).
- It **cannot be `static`** (constructors belong to instances, not the class itself).
- It **cannot be inherited** but can be called in derived class constructors.
- It **cannot be virtual** but can participate in polymorphic behavior.
- It **cannot be explicitly `final`** (though derived classes can restrict instantiation in different ways).
- It **cannot be overridden**, but constructor delegation can be used.
- It **can be overloaded** (multiple constructors with different parameters).

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;

    // Constructor
    Car(string b) {
        brand = b;
        cout << "Constructor is called. Car brand: " << brand << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1("Toyota"); // Constructor is automatically called
    Car car2("Honda");  // Another object creation calls constructor again
}
```

### What Are the Types of Constructor?

A **constructor** is a special member function of a class that initializes objects. In **C++**, there are several types of constructors, each serving different purposes.

#### **1. Default Constructor**
- A **constructor that takes no parameters**.
- Initializes an object with default values.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;

    // Default Constructor
    Example() {
        x = 0;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Value of x: " << x << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj; // Calls Default Constructor
    obj.display(); // Output: Value of x: 0
}
```

#### **2. Parameterized Constructor**
- A constructor that **takes arguments**.
- Used when we need to pass values while creating an object.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Example(int value) {
        x = value;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Value of x: " << x << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj(10); // Calls Parameterized Constructor
    obj.display(); // Output: Value of x: 10
}
```

#### **3. Copy Constructor**

A constructor that creates a new object by copying an existing object.
Used for object cloning.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Example(int value) {
        x = value;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    Example(const Example &obj) {
        x = obj.x;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Value of x: " << x << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(20);  // Calls Parameterized Constructor
    Example obj2 = obj1; // Calls Copy Constructor

    obj2.display(); // Output: Value of x: 20
}
```

#### **4. # Move Constructor in C++ (C++11 and Later)

A **Move Constructor** is a special constructor that moves resources from a temporary (r-value) object to a new object, instead of copying them. This helps in optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary deep copies.

**Why Use a Move Constructor?**
- **Performance Optimization:** Moves resources instead of duplicating them.
- **Efficient Memory Management:** Prevents redundant memory allocations.
- **Useful for Large Objects:** Especially beneficial when dealing with dynamic memory allocation (e.g., objects with pointers).

- A move constructor takes an **r-value reference (`&&`)** as its parameter:

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int* ptr; // Pointer to dynamically allocated memory

    // Constructor
    Example(int value) {
        ptr = new int(value);
        cout << "Constructor called!" << endl;
    }

    // Move Constructor
    Example(Example &&obj) {
        cout << "Move Constructor called!" << endl;
        ptr = obj.ptr;  // Transfer ownership of the resource
        obj.ptr = nullptr; // Nullify the source pointer
    }

    // Display Function
    void display() {
        if (ptr)
            cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
        else
            cout << "Object moved!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(30);  // Calls Constructor
    Example obj2 = std::move(obj1); // Calls Move Constructor

    obj2.display(); // Output: Value: 30
    obj1.display(); // Output: Object moved!
}
```

## What is the Difference Between Constructor vs Method?

| **Constructor**                                                          | **Method**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Has the same name as the class name.                                     | Name and class name are not necessarily the same.       |
| Used to initialize an object of its class.                               | A set of instructions that perform specific operations. |
| Creates an instance of a class.                                          | Executes code but does not create an instance.          |
| Invoked automatically when an object of the class is created.            | Explicitly called in the program.                       |
| Cannot be inherited by derived classes.                                  | Can be inherited by derived classes.                    |
| Has no return type (not even `void`).                                    | Must have a return type (e.g., `void`, `int`, etc.).    |
| Cannot be called explicitly (only invoked during object creation).       | Can be called explicitly multiple times in the program. |
| Cannot be declared as `static`.                                          | Can be declared as `static`.                            |
| C++ does not provide a constructor automatically if a custom one exists. | There are no methods provided by default in C++.        |

## Is it possible to overload a constructor? What is constructor overloading, what are its benefits, and what are its conditions or rules?

### Is it possible to overload a constructor?
Yes, **constructors can be overloaded** by:
- Changing the **number of parameters**.
- Changing the **data types of parameters**.

This allows flexibility in object initialization.

```cpp
class Example {
    int a, b;

public:
    // Default constructor
    Example() {
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
    }

    // Constructor with one integer parameter
    Example(int x) {
        a = x;
        b = 0;
    }

    // Constructor with two integer parameters
    Example(int x, int y) {
        a = x;
        b = y;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example e1;      // Calls default constructor
    Example e2(10);  // Calls constructor with 1 argument
    Example e3(10, 20); // Calls constructor with 2 arguments

    e1.display();
    e2.display();
    e3.display();
}
```

### What is Constructor Overloading?
- Constructor overloading means a class can have **multiple constructors** with different parameter lists.
- The compiler **automatically selects** the correct constructor based on the arguments passed.
- This helps in **flexibility** and **various ways of object initialization**.

```cpp
class Complex {
    int a, b;

public:
    // Default constructor
    Complex() {
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
    }

    // Constructor with two parameters
    Complex(int x, int y) {
        a = x;
        b = y;
    }

    // Constructor with one parameter
    Complex(int x) {
        a = x;
        b = 0;
    }

    void printNumber() {
        cout << "Your number is " << a << " + " << b << "i" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(4, 6); // Calls constructor with 2 arguments
    c1.printNumber();

    Complex c2(5);    // Calls constructor with 1 argument
    c2.printNumber();

    Complex c3;       // Calls default constructor
    c3.printNumber();
}
```

### Benefits of Constructor Overloading
1. **Flexibility in Object Initialization**
   - Different constructors allow initializing an object with **varied sets of data**.
2. **Code Reusability**
   - Avoids redundant initialization code by providing **multiple ways** to create an object.
3. **Improved Readability and Maintainability**
   - Makes code **more intuitive** and **easier to maintain**.
4. **Default Values Handling**
   - Allows defining a **default constructor** along with parameterized constructors.
5. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**
   - Users do not need to know **internal implementation details** for object initialization.

```cpp
class Rectangle {
    int length, width;

public:
    // Default Constructor
    Rectangle() {
        length = 0;
        width = 0;
    }

    // Constructor with one argument
    Rectangle(int side) {
        length = width = side;
    }

    // Constructor with two arguments
    Rectangle(int l, int w) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Rectangle: " << length << " x " << width << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle r1;         // Calls default constructor
    Rectangle r2(5);      // Calls constructor with one argument
    Rectangle r3(4, 6);   // Calls constructor with two arguments

    r1.display(); // Output: Rectangle: 0 x 0
    r2.display(); // Output: Rectangle: 5 x 5
    r3.display(); // Output: Rectangle: 4 x 6
}
```

### Can a Constructor or Function be Overloaded by Changing the Return Type?

- **No**, a constructor or function **cannot** be overloaded **only** by changing the return type.

**Why?**
- **Constructors** do not have a return type, so changing it is not possible.
- **Functions** cannot be overloaded **only** by changing the return type because the compiler will not be able to distinguish between two functions with the same name and parameter list but different return types.

```cpp
// Invalid Function Overloading (Return Type Change Only)
class Example {
public:
    int func() { return 10; }  // Function returning int
    double func() { return 20.5; }  // ❌ Error: Function already declared
};

int main() {
    Example obj;
    cout << obj.func();
}
```

### **Correct Way to Overload Functions**
- To properly overload a function or constructor, change the number or type of parameters.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int func(int x) { return x; } // Function with int parameter
    double func(double x) { return x; } // Function with double parameter
};

int main() {
    Example obj;
    cout << obj.func(10) << endl;     // Calls func(int)
    cout << obj.func(10.5) << endl;   // Calls func(double)
}
```

## What is a Copy Constructor: Is the Object Passed by Value or Reference, and Why?

The object is **passed by reference** (`const ClassName &obj`), **not by value**.

### 1️. **Avoids Infinite Recursion**
- If the copy constructor accepted an object **by value**, it would call itself **infinitely**.
- This happens because passing by value requires making a **copy first**, which again calls the copy constructor.

### 2️. **More Efficient**
- Passing **by reference** prevents unnecessary copying, reducing **memory usage** and improving **performance**.

### 3️. **Preserves the Original Object**
- Passing **by reference** ensures the **original object remains unchanged**.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;

    // Copy Constructor (Passing by Reference)
    Example(const Example &obj) {
        x = obj.x;
        cout << "Copy Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Value of x: " << x << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1;  // Default object
    obj1.x = 10;

    Example obj2 = obj1;  // Calls Copy Constructor
    obj2.display(); // Output: Value of x: 10
}
```

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int a;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Example(int x) { a = x; }
    // Copy Constructor
    Example(const Example &obj) { a = obj.a; }
};
// This ensures efficient object copying without recursion or performance issues. 🚀
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## Where is a Copy Constructor Called Implicitly?

The **copy constructor** is **automatically invoked** in the following cases:

### **1. When Passing an Object by Value to a Function**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;

    // Copy Constructor
    Example(const Example &obj) {
        x = obj.x;
        cout << "Copy Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

    Example(int value) { x = value; }

    void display() { cout << "Value: " << x << endl; }
};

// Function accepting an object by value (Triggers Copy Constructor)
void show(Example obj) {
    obj.display();
}

int main() {
    Example obj1(10);
    show(obj1); // Copy Constructor called when passing by value
}
// Copy Constructor is called when passing obj1 by value.
```

### **2. When Returning an Object by Value from a Function**

```cpp
Example createObject() {
    Example temp(20);
    return temp; // Copy Constructor is called (may be optimized by RVO)
}

int main() {
    Example obj2 = createObject(); // Copy Constructor is called
}
// Modern compilers may optimize this with Return Value Optimization (RVO) to avoid unnecessary copies.
```

**Modern compilers optimize this using Return Value Optimization (RVO) to avoid unnecessary copies.**

### **3. When Initializing an Object Using Another Object**

```cpp
Example obj1(30);
Example obj2 = obj1;
// Copy Constructor is called when obj2 is initialized from obj1.
```

### **4. When Assigning an Object to Another at Declaration**

```cpp
Example obj1(40);
Example obj2(obj1);
// This is equivalent to Example obj2 = obj1; and invokes the Copy Constructor.
```

## What is the Difference Between Copy Constructor vs Assignment Operator?

| **Copy Constructor**                                                    | **Assignment Operator**                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is an overloaded constructor.                                        | It is an operator.                                                                                            |
| Creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.                   | Assigns the value of one object to another object, both of which already exist.                               |
| Used when a new object is created from an existing object.              | Used when assigning an existing object to another existing object.                                            |
| Both objects use separate memory locations.                             | Both objects share the same memory but use two different reference variables that point to the same location. |
| If no copy constructor is defined, the compiler provides a default one. | If the assignment operator is not overloaded, a bitwise copy is performed by default.                         |

### 1️. **Copy Constructor**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;

    // Copy Constructor
    Example(const Example &obj) {
        x = obj.x;
        cout << "Copy Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

    Example(int value) { x = value; }

    void display() { cout << "Value: " << x << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(10);
    Example obj2 = obj1; // Copy Constructor Called

    obj2.display();
}
```
- Creates a new object `(obj2)` as a copy of `obj1`.

### 2. **Assignment Operator**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;

    Example(int value) { x = value; }

    // Overloaded Assignment Operator
    Example& operator=(const Example &obj) {
        x = obj.x;
        cout << "Assignment Operator Called" << endl;
        return *this;
    }

    void display() { cout << "Value: " << x << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(10);
    Example obj2(20);

    obj2 = obj1; // Assignment Operator Called
    obj2.display();
}
```
- Assigns values from `obj1` to `obj2` (both objects already exist).

## What Does It Mean by Constructors with Default Arguments?

Default arguments in a **constructor** are values that are **automatically used** if no explicit values are provided when creating an object.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Simplifies object creation** by allowing optional parameters.
- **Avoids function overloading** when default values are sufficient.
- **Enhances code readability** by reducing redundant code.

### 1. **Constructor with Default Argument**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    // Constructor with a default argument
    Example(int x = 10) {
        cout << "Value: " << x << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1;    // Uses default value (10)
    Example obj2(20); // Uses provided value (20)
}
```

### 2. **Multiple Default Arguments**
```cpp
class Simple {
    int data1, data2, data3;

public:
    // Constructor with multiple default arguments
    Simple(int a, int b = 9, int c = 8) {
        data1 = a;
        data2 = b;
        data3 = c;
    }

    void printData();
};

void Simple::printData() {
    cout << "Values: " << data1 << ", " << data2 << ", " << data3 << endl;
}

int main() {
    Simple s(12, 13); // `c` uses the default value (8)
    s.printData();
}
```
- The constructor **automatically** assigns default values for parameters that are not explicitly provided.

## What is Dynamic Initialization of Objects Using Constructors?

Dynamic initialization of objects means that **objects are initialized at runtime**, rather than at compile-time.

### **Why Use Dynamic Initialization?**
- When **data varies** and is unknown at compile-time.
- When **resources need to be allocated dynamically**.
- When **input values change at runtime**.

### **Dynamic Initialization in a Banking System**
```cpp
class BankDeposit {
    int principal;
    int years;
    float interestRate;
    float returnValue;

public:
    BankDeposit() {} // Default constructor

    // Constructor with float interest rate (decimal format)
    BankDeposit(int p, int y, float r) {
        principal = p;
        years = y;
        interestRate = r;
        returnValue = principal;

        for (int i = 0; i < y; i++) {
            returnValue *= (1 + interestRate);
        }
    }

    // Constructor with integer interest rate (percentage format)
    BankDeposit(int p, int y, int r) {
        principal = p;
        years = y;
        interestRate = float(r) / 100; // Convert percentage to decimal
        returnValue = principal;

        for (int i = 0; i < y; i++) {
            returnValue *= (1 + interestRate);
        }
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "Principal amount: " << principal
             << "\nReturn value after " << years
             << " years: " << returnValue << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    int p, y, r;
    float R;

    // Taking user input dynamically
    cout << "Enter principal, years, and interest rate (decimal format): ";
    cin >> p >> y >> R;
    BankDeposit bd1(p, y, R);
    bd1.show();

    cout << "\nEnter principal, years, and interest rate (percentage format): ";
    cin >> p >> y >> r;
    BankDeposit bd2(p, y, r);
    bd2.show();
}
```

- Here, objects are initialized at runtime based on user input.

### **Dynamic Object Allocation with `new`**

- Objects can also be created dynamically using the `new` keyword.

```cpp
Example* obj = new Example(50); // Dynamically allocated object
```

- This allows flexibility in memory allocation and is useful for managing heap memory efficiently.

- **Dynamic initialization occurs at runtime, unlike static initialization at compile-time.**
- **It is useful for variable input scenarios like user input or file-based initialization.**
- **Memory can be allocated dynamically using the new keyword.**

**Best Practice: Use dynamic memory allocation wisely to prevent memory leaks.**

## What is Constructor Delegation?

- Constructor delegation is a feature in C++ that allows one constructor to **call another constructor** within the same class.
- This helps avoid code duplication and makes object initialization cleaner and more **maintainable**.

### Why Use Constructor Delegation?
- Avoids redundant code – No need to repeat initialization logic.
- Improves readability – Reduces complexity in constructors.
- Maintains consistency – Ensures uniform initialization.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    Example() : Example(10) { }  // Delegating to another constructor
    Example(int x) { cout << x; }
};
// Here, the default constructor calls the parameterized constructor.
```

```cpp
class Rectangle {
    int length;
    int width;

public:
    // 🎯 Primary Constructor
    Rectangle(int l, int w) : length(l), width(w) {
        cout << "Primary constructor called" << endl;
    }

    // 🎯 Delegating Constructor (calls the primary constructor)
    Rectangle(int side) : Rectangle(side, side) {
        cout << "Delegating constructor called" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Length: " << length << ", Width: " << width << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect1(10, 20); // Calls primary constructor
    rect1.display();

    Rectangle square(5); // Calls delegating constructor
    square.display();
}
```

## What is a Constructor Initialization List, and Why Do We Use It?

A **constructor initialization list** in C++ is used to **initialize class member variables** before the constructor body executes.

### Why Use Constructor Initialization Lists?
1. **Required for `const` and reference members** (since they must be initialized at declaration).
2. **More efficient than assignment** (avoids extra assignments in the constructor body).
3. **Essential for initializing base classes in inheritance.**

### Syntax of Constructor Initialization List
```cpp
class ClassName {
    DataType member1;
    DataType member2;

public:
    ClassName(Type param1, Type param2) : member1(param1), member2(param2) {
        // Constructor body (executes after initialization)
    }
};
```

### Initializing `const` and Member Variables
```cpp
class Student {
    const int id;   // Constant member
    string name;

public:
    // 🎯 Constructor using Initialization List
    Student(int studentId, string studentName) : id(studentId), name(studentName) {
        cout << "Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1(101, "Ahad");
    s1.display();
}
```

### When is a Constructor Initialization List Required?
| Use Initialization List When... | Don't Use It When... |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Initializing **const** members. | Members can be assigned in the constructor body. |
| Initializing **reference** variables. | Initialization order does not matter. |
| Initializing base class members in **inheritance**. | Default initialization is sufficient. |
| Optimizing performance (avoiding extra assignments). | There are no performance concerns. |

### Initialization List in Inheritance
```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    Parent(int x) { cout << "Parent Constructor: " << x << endl; }
};

class Child : public Parent {
    int value;
public:
    Child(int a, int b) : Parent(a), value(b) {
        cout << "Child Constructor: " << value << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Child obj(5, 10);
}
```

- **The base class constructor (`Parent(a)`) is called before the `Child` constructor body runs.**

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Can a Constructor be Private or Protected?

Yes, a constructor in C++ can be **private** or **protected**. This is commonly used in **Singleton Design Pattern** and when restricting object creation to controlled methods.

### Private Constructor
A private constructor prevents direct instantiation of a class. It is useful when creating singleton classes.

```cpp
class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    Singleton() {} // Private Constructor

public:
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (!instance) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
};

// Definition of static member
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    Singleton* obj = Singleton::getInstance(); // Allowed
    // Singleton obj2; // ❌ Not Allowed (Constructor is private)
}
```

### Protected Constructor

A **protected constructor** allows derived classes to create objects but prevents direct instantiation of the base class. This is useful when a class is meant to be inherited but should not be instantiated on its own.

```cpp
class Base {
protected:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor Called" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor Called" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    // Base obj; // ❌ Not Allowed (Protected Constructor)
    Derived obj; // ✅ Allowed
}
```

- **Private Constructors** are used in Singleton Patterns.
- **Protected Constructors** are used when inheritance is involved.

## Can a Constructor be Static or Const? Why or Why Not?

### Static Constructor
- **Constructors cannot be static** in C++ because they are meant to initialize an instance of a class.
- A static member belongs to the class itself, not to any particular object.
- A constructor’s purpose is to construct objects, but a `static` function has no access to instance-specific data.

```cpp
// (Invalid Code)
class Example {
public:
    static Example() { // ❌ Not Allowed
        cout << "Static Constructor Called";
    }
};
```

- **Error**: Static functions cannot access non-static members.

### Const Constructor ❌
- **Constructors** cannot be `const` because their purpose is to initialize an object, which requires modifying the object's members.
- Declaring a constructor as `const` would mean it cannot modify any member variables, which contradicts its purpose.

```cpp
// (Invalid Code)
class Example {
public:
    const Example() { // ❌ Not Allowed
        cout << "Const Constructor Called";
    }
};
```

- **Error**: Constructor modifies the object during initialization, so it cannot be const.

### Why Are They Not Allowed?
- **Static Constructor** - Cannot modify instance members; constructors initialize objects.
- **Const Constructor** - Prevents modifications, but constructors must modify members during initialization.

## Can We Make a Constructor Private? How Will We Create an Object of Such a Class?

### **Yes!** A Constructor Can Be Private
A **private constructor** restricts object creation outside the class.
It is commonly used in the **Singleton Design Pattern** to ensure that only **one instance** of the class exists.

### How Do We Create an Object Then?
By using a **static function inside the class** that returns the same instance.

```cpp
// Singleton Class with a Private Constructor
class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance; // Pointer to store the single instance

    // Private Constructor
    Singleton() {
        cout << "Singleton Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

public:
    // Static method to provide a global access point
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (!instance) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
};

// Define the static member
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    Singleton* obj1 = Singleton::getInstance(); // ✅ Allowed
    Singleton* obj2 = Singleton::getInstance(); // ✅ Returns the same instance
    cout << "obj1 and obj2 are the same instance: " << (obj1 == obj2) << endl;
}
```

- Private Constructors prevent direct object creation from outside the class.
- Singleton Pattern ensures only one instance of a class is created.
- Objects are accessed through a static method like getInstance().

## What is a Destructor? When Do We Need to Define Destructors?

### What is a Destructor?
A **destructor** is a special member function of a class that is **automatically called** when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

#### Key Features:
- **Releases resources** such as dynamically allocated memory or file handles.
- Has the **same name as the class** but is **prefixed with `~`** (tilde).
- **Automatically called** when:
   - The object **goes out of scope**.
   - The `delete` operator is used on a dynamically allocated object.
- **Does not take any arguments** and **does not return a value**.

```cpp
class ResourceHandler {
    int* data; // Pointer to dynamically allocated memory

public:
    // Constructor
    ResourceHandler(int value) {
        data = new int(value); // Allocate memory
        cout << "ResourceHandler constructed with value: " << *data << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~ResourceHandler() {
        delete data; // Deallocate memory
        cout << "ResourceHandler destroyed and memory deallocated" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    ResourceHandler handler(10); // ✅ Constructor is called here
    // ✅ Destructor will be called automatically when 'handler' goes out of scope
}
```

### What are the Rules for Creating a Destructor?

- The destructor has **the same name as the class** but is prefixed with `~` (tilde).
- It **cannot take arguments** and **does not return a value**.
- There can be **only one destructor** per class (it cannot be overloaded).
- It is **automatically called** when:
   - The object **goes out of scope**.
   - The `delete` operator is used on a dynamically allocated object.
- It is used to **release resources** (e.g., dynamic memory, file handles).
- If a class has dynamically allocated resources, a **destructor must be explicitly defined** to prevent **memory leaks**.
- If a base class destructor is **not virtual**, deleting a derived class object via a base class pointer may cause **undefined behavior**.
- If a destructor is declared as **private**, the object cannot be destroyed directly, often used in **Singleton patterns**.

### When Do We Need to Define Destructors?

A **destructor** is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. However, in some cases, defining a **custom destructor** is necessary.

#### When Should We Define a Destructor?
You should explicitly define a destructor **when your class handles resources** such as:

1. **Dynamically allocated memory**
   - If a class allocates memory using `new`, a destructor should use `delete` to prevent **memory leaks**.

2. **File handling**
   - If a class **opens a file**, the destructor should **close it** to prevent resource leaks.

3. **Database connections or network sockets**
   - If a class manages a **database connection** or **network socket**, the destructor should close it properly.

4. **Releasing acquired system resources**
   - If a class acquires **mutex locks, threads, or GPU resources**, the destructor should ensure they are released.

5. **Proper cleanup in inheritance (Virtual Destructor)**
   - If a **base class** has a destructor, it should be **virtual** to ensure proper cleanup of derived class objects.

```cpp
class Example {
private:
    int* data; // Dynamically allocated memory

public:
    // Constructor
    Example(int value) {
        data = new int(value); // Allocate memory
        cout << "Constructor: Memory allocated" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Example() {
        delete data; // Free memory
        cout << "Destructor: Memory deallocated" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj(10); // ✅ Constructor is called
    // ✅ Destructor is automatically called when obj goes out of scope
}
```

## Is it Possible to Overload a Destructor? What is Destructor Overloading, Its Benefits, and Why Is It Not Possible?

No, **destructor overloading is not possible** in C++. A class can have **only one destructor**.

#### Rules for a Destructor:
- The destructor must:
  - Have the **same name** as the class.
  - Have a **tilde (~) prefix**.
  - **Not accept parameters** and **not return a value**.

### Why Can't We Overload a Destructor?
1. **Only One Destructor Allowed** – A class can have only one destructor.
2. **No Parameters Allowed** – Destructors **cannot take arguments**.
3. **Automatic Invocation** – The compiler automatically calls the destructor, so multiple versions would create ambiguity.

Since a destructor is **automatically called when an object is destroyed**, the compiler **would not know which destructor to invoke** if multiple destructors existed.

```cpp
// Destructor Overloading (❌ Not Possible)
class Example {
public:
    ~Example() {
        cout << "Default Destructor Called!" << endl;
    }

    // ❌ This will cause a compilation error!
    // ~Example(int x) {
    //     cout << "Overloaded Destructor Called!" << endl;
    // }
};
```

### **Alternative: Handling Multiple Cleanup Scenarios**

Instead of overloading the destructor, we can use **function overloading** or **custom cleanup methods**.

#### **Using a Cleanup Function**

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    Example() {
        cout << "Constructor Called!" << endl;
    }

    ~Example() {
        cout << "Destructor Called!" << endl;
    }

    void cleanup(int mode) {  // Custom cleanup method
        if (mode == 1) {
            cout << "Performing cleanup mode 1..." << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Performing general cleanup..." << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj;
    obj.cleanup(1); // Manually calling a cleanup method
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Why Does a Class Have Only One Destructor & Why Do We Need One?

- A **destructor** is responsible for **cleaning up resources** when an object is destroyed.
- Unlike **constructors**, which can have multiple overloads for different ways of initializing an object, a **destructor’s job is always the same**:
- **Release resources**
- **Clean up the object** before it is removed from memory

### Why Does a Class Have Only One Destructor?

#### 1️. Single Cleanup Responsibility
- A class can be **initialized in multiple ways** (using different constructors), but **destruction is always a single operation**.
- No matter how an object is created, it **must be destroyed in a single, predictable way**.

#### 2️. Automatic Invocation
- The **destructor is called automatically** when an object **goes out of scope**.
- If multiple destructors were allowed, the **compiler wouldn’t know which one to call**.

#### 3️. Memory and Resource Management
- A class may allocate resources (**dynamic memory, file handles, sockets, etc.**).
- The destructor ensures that **all allocated resources are released properly**.

```cpp
// Only One Destructor Allowed
class ABC {
public:
    int a;

    // Multiple constructors (Constructor Overloading)
    ABC() { cout << "Default Constructor\n"; }
    ABC(int) { cout << "Parameterized Constructor\n"; }

    // Single Destructor
    ~ABC() { cout << "Destructor Called\n"; }
};

int main() {
    ABC obj1;     // Calls default constructor
    ABC obj2(5);  // Calls parameterized constructor

    return 0;  // Destructor is automatically called for both objects
}
```

### **If There’s Only One Destructor, Why Do We Need One?**

- **A destructor prevents memory leaks** by **freeing dynamically allocated memory**.
- **It ensures proper cleanup** of resources like **file handles, sockets, or dynamic arrays**.
- **Without a destructor, a program can suffer from memory leaks** and **resource mismanagement**.

```cpp
class Example {
private:
    int* data; // Dynamically allocated memory

public:
    // Constructor: Allocates memory
    Example(int value) {
        data = new int(value);
        cout << "Constructor: Memory allocated for " << *data << endl;
    }

    // Destructor: Frees memory
    ~Example() {
        delete data;
        cout << "Destructor: Memory deallocated" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(10); // Constructor is called
    Example obj2(20); // Constructor is called

    // Destructors will be called automatically when obj1 and obj2 go out of scope
    return 0;
}
```

### **Can We Call a Destructor Explicitly?**

- **Yes, but it is NOT recommended**
- If you explicitly call a destructor, the **object’s memory might be released prematurely**.
- When the compiler **automatically calls the destructor again**, it can lead to **undefined behavior** (e.g., double deletion error).

#### Calling Destructor Manually (Not Recommended)

```cpp
int main() {
    Example obj(30);
    obj.~Example();  // ❌ Explicit call to destructor (NOT recommended)
}
```

- **Let the compiler handle destructor calls instead!**

- A **class can have only one destructor** because destruction is a single process.
- A **destructor ensures proper cleanup** of dynamically allocated resources.
- **Calling a destructor manually can cause memory issues** – let the compiler handle it!

- **Remember:** Constructors can be overloaded, but **destructors cannot!** 🚀

## Can a Destructor be Private or Protected?

Yes, **a destructor can be `private` or `protected`**, but this is not common.
Usually, destructors are `public` so that objects can be **automatically destroyed**
when they go out of scope.

### Why Make a Destructor Private or Protected?
- **Prevent Direct Deletion** → Stops objects from being deleted using `delete`.
- **Implement Singleton Pattern** → Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
- **Prevent Stack Allocation** → Ensures objects are created dynamically.
- **Enforce Custom Object Lifecycle** → Controls how and when an object is destroyed.

- **Private destructors are commonly used in the Singleton Design Pattern.**

### **1. Private Destructor (Prevent Direct Object Creation)**

```cpp
class Example {
private:
    ~Example() { cout << "Destructor Called\n"; } // Private Destructor

public:
    static void destroy(Example* obj) {
        delete obj; // Manual deletion via static method
    }

    void show() { cout << "Hello from Example\n"; }

    // Factory method to create objects dynamically
    static Example* createInstance() {
        return new Example();
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example obj; ❌ ERROR: Destructor is private, stack allocation is forbidden

    Example* obj = Example::createInstance();  // ✅ Allowed (dynamic allocation)
    obj->show();
    Example::destroy(obj);  // ✅ Destructor called manually
}
// Since the destructor is private, objects must be created dynamically!
// Only destroy() can delete the object, preventing accidental deletions.
```

### **2. Protected Destructor (Inheritance Use-Case)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
protected:
    ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor Called\n"; } // Protected Destructor

public:
    void show() { cout << "Hello from Base\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor Called\n"; }
};

int main() {
    // Base obj; ❌ ERROR: Destructor is protected, cannot create Base objects directly

    Derived obj;  // ✅ Allowed (Derived class can access protected destructor)
    obj.show();

// A protected destructor allows inheritance but prevents standalone object creation.
// This is useful when designing base classes that should only be inherited!
}
```

###  **When Should You Use Private or Protected Destructors?**

| Destructor Type  | Use Case |
|-----------------|----------|
| **`public`** (Default) | Normal object lifecycle, automatic deletion. |
| **`private`** | Enforces dynamic allocation, prevents accidental deletion. |
| **`protected`** | Allows inheritance but prevents direct instantiation. |

###  **Can You Explicitly Call a Private Destructor?**

- **No**, it **cannot be called outside the class**.
- **Yes**, it **can be called within a friend function**.

#### **Calling a Private Destructor Using a Friend Function**

```cpp
class Example {
private:
    ~Example() { cout << "Destructor Called\n"; }

    friend void destroyObject(Example*); // Friend function declaration
};

void destroyObject(Example* obj) {
    delete obj;  // ✅ Allowed, as it's a friend function
}

int main() {
    // Example obj; ❌ ERROR: Destructor is private

    Example* obj = new Example();
    destroyObject(obj); // ✅ Destructor is called via friend function
}
```

- **Public Destructor** → Default, objects destroyed normally.
- **Private Destructor** → Prevents stack allocation, used in Singletons.
- **Protected Destructor** → Used in base classes to enforce inheritance.
- **Friend functions or static methods** can delete objects with private destructors.

## Can a Destructor be Static or Const? Why or Why Not?

**No, destructors cannot be `static` or `const`.**

### Why Can't a Destructor be `static`?
- A `static` member belongs to the **class itself**, not an instance of the class.
- But **destructors are meant to clean up instances of a class** when they go out of scope.
- If a destructor were `static`, it wouldn't be able to access instance-specific data.

```cpp
// (Invalid Code)
class Example {
public:
    static ~Example() {  // ❌ ERROR: Destructor cannot be static
        cout << "Destructor Called\n";
    }
};
```

#### **Why is this invalid?**
- A static destructor wouldn't know which object to destroy.
- The compiler doesn't allow it, as destructors are tied to object lifecycle.

### Why Can't a Destructor be `const`?
- A `const` function promises not to modify the object.
- However, a destructor must modify the object by releasing resources and deallocating memory.

```cpp
// (Invalid Code)
class Example {
public:
    ~Example() const {  // ❌ ERROR: Destructor cannot be const
        cout << "Destructor Called\n";
    }
};
```

#### **Why is this invalid?**
- A const destructor contradicts its purpose—it must modify the object by freeing resources.
- The compiler prevents this to ensure proper object cleanup.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is the Order of Constructor and Destructor Calling Sequence?

- When an object is created, **constructors are called in a specific order**.
- Similarly, when an object is destroyed, **destructors are called in reverse order**.

- This order is especially important when **inheritance** is involved.
- Understanding the **calling sequence** ensures proper memory management and avoids issues like **memory leaks**.

### 1. Constructor & Destructor Order **Without Inheritance**

When a **single class** (no inheritance) is used:
- The **constructor executes when the object is created**.
- The **destructor executes when the object goes out of scope**.

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    Example() { cout << "Constructor Called\n"; }
    ~Example() { cout << "Destructor Called\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Example obj;
    // Step 1️⃣: Constructor executes when obj is created.
    // Step 2️⃣: Destructor executes when obj goes out of scope.
}
```

### 2. Constructor & Destructor Order **With Inheritance**

When inheritance is used:
- The Base Class Constructor runs first.
- The Derived Class Constructor runs second.
- When destroying the object, destructors are called in reverse order:
    - **Derived Class** Destructor runs first.
    - **Base Class** Destructor runs last.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    A() { cout << "A Constructor\n"; }
    ~A() { cout << "A Destructor\n"; }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B() { cout << "B Constructor\n"; }
    ~B() { cout << "B Destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    B obj;
    // Step 1️⃣: A Constructor runs first.
    // Step 2️⃣: B Constructor runs second.
    // Step 3️⃣: B Destructor runs first (reverse order).
    // Step 4️⃣: A Destructor runs last.
}
```

### 3. Constructor & Destructor Order With **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

When objects are created dynamically using `new`, they must be `deleted` properly using delete.

#### What happens if there's no virtual destructor?
- If the base class destructor is not `virtual`, the derived class destructor will not be called, causing a memory leak.

```cpp
// Without Virtual Destructor (Memory Leak Issue)
class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor\n"; }
    ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor\n"; }  // ❌ Not virtual
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor\n"; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj;  // ❌ Only Base Destructor is called, Derived Destructor is skipped!
}
```

- **Problem**: Memory allocated for Derived is not freed properly!

#### **Correct Approach**: Use a Virtual Destructor
- Adding a **virtual destructor** in the base class ensures proper cleanup.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base Constructor\n"; }
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor\n"; }  // ✅ Virtual Destructor
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor\n"; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj;  // ✅ Both Derived and Base destructors are called!
}
```

#### **Why use a virtual destructor?**
- Ensures proper cleanup of derived class objects.
- Prevents memory leaks in polymorphism scenarios.

| **Scenario**                                  | **Constructor Order** | **Destructor Order**                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **No Inheritance**                            | Constructor runs first | Destructor runs last                |
| **With Inheritance**                          | Base → Derived       | Derived → Base                      |
| **Dynamic Allocation (No Virtual Destructor)** | Base → Derived       | ❌ Only Base Destructor runs (Memory leak) |
| **Dynamic Allocation (With Virtual Destructor)** | Base → Derived       | Derived → Base                      |

## What is Encapsulation? Why is it important in software development? What are its key features?

Encapsulation is the **combining of data members and member functions** that manipulate them into a single unit, ensuring **sensitive data is hidden** from users.

### Alternative Definitions:
- **Encapsulation** is the **binding of data and methods** that manipulate it into a single unit, **restricting direct access** to maintain security and integrity.
- - **Encapsulation** is the principle of **hiding internal details** of an object and only exposing necessary functionality.

**Main things:**
1. **Data Hiding** – Restricts access to internal members of an object.
2. **Bundling of Data & Methods** – Data and its related methods are grouped together.

**Real Life Examples:**
- 🏏 **Cricket Ground**: Captains, players, umpires – only certain actions are allowed.
- 🏦 **Bank Account**: Only authorized methods can modify balance.
- 🎮 **Gaming Apps**: Health, score, and player stats are securely managed.
- 🏥 **Medical Systems**: Patient data is protected from unauthorized access.

### **Why is Encapsulation Important**
- **Data Hiding** – Prevents direct access to data, reducing risks.
- **Security** – Protects critical data from unintended modifications.
- **Modularity** – Encourages organized and reusable code.
- **Maintainability** – Simplifies debugging and future modifications.

### **Key Features of Encapsulation**
1. **Data Hiding** – Private members cannot be accessed directly.
2. **Data Protection** – Prevents unintended modifications.
3. **Controlled Access** – Getters and setters allow safe data manipulation.
4. **Modular Code** – Improves structure and scalability.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is the Concept of Setters and Getters? Why Do We Use Them? Provide a Code Example of Encapsulation.

### **What are Setters and Getters?**
Setters and getters are **special functions** used in encapsulation to **control access to private data members** in a class.

- **Getter (Accessor)** – Retrieves the value of a private member.
- **Setter (Mutator)** – Updates the value of a private member safely.

### **Why Do We Use Setters and Getters?**
- **Encapsulation** – Prevents direct access to private data.
- **Security** – Controls how data is modified.
- **Validation** – Ensures only valid data is set.
- **Flexibility** – Code can be modified without breaking existing functionality.

```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;  // Private data member (data hiding)

public:
    // Constructor
    BankAccount(double initialBalance) { balance = initialBalance; }

    // Getter (Controlled Access)
    double getBalance() { return balance; }

    // Setter (Ensuring Valid Data)
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) balance -= amount;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount myAccount(5000);

    myAccount.deposit(1500);
    cout << "Current Balance: " << myAccount.getBalance() << endl;

    myAccount.withdraw(2000);
    cout << "Updated Balance: " << myAccount.getBalance() << endl;
    // myAccount.balance = 10000; ❌ ERROR: Cannot access private member directly
}
```
```cpp
class Player {
private:
    int health;  // Private data member (data hiding)

public:
    // Constructor
    Player(int h) { health = h; }

    // Getter (Controlled Access)
    int getHealth() { return health; }

    // Setter (Ensuring Valid Data)
    void setHealth(int h) {
        if (h >= 0) health = h;
    }

    void show() { cout << "Player Health: " << health << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Player p1(100);
    p1.show();

    p1.setHealth(80);  // ✅ Allowed via setter
    cout << "Updated Health: " << p1.getHealth() << endl;
    // p1.health = 50; ❌ ERROR: Cannot access private member directly
}
```
```cpp
class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;

public:
    // Setter for name
    void setName(string newName) {
        if (!newName.empty())  // Validation
            name = newName;
    }

    // Getter for name
    string getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for age
    void setAge(int newAge) {
        if (newAge > 0)  // Ensuring valid age
            age = newAge;
    }

    // Getter for age
    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student;

    student.setName("Ahad Ali");
    student.setAge(21);

    cout << "Student Name: " << student.getName() << endl;
    cout << "Student Age: " << student.getAge() << endl;
    // student.age = 25; ❌ ERROR: Direct access is not allowed due to encapsulation.
}

## How does Encapsulation promote modular code?

### **What is Modular Code?**
Modular code refers to a **structured programming approach** where code is divided into **independent, reusable modules**, making development and maintenance easier.

### **How Encapsulation Helps in Modular Code**
Encapsulation **bundles data and methods** into a single unit (class), ensuring that internal implementation details are hidden from other parts of the program. This leads to:

- **Code Reusability** – Well-defined classes can be reused in different projects.
- **Separation of Concerns** – Different components handle their own responsibilities.
- **Easy Debugging** – Each class operates independently, simplifying troubleshooting.
- **Improved Maintainability** – Changes to one module don’t affect others, reducing errors.
- **Enhanced Security** – Restricts direct access to critical data.

```cpp
// Encapsulated Module: BankAccount
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;

public:
    BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = (initialBalance >= 0) ? initialBalance : 0;
    }

    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) balance -= amount;
    }

    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};

// Another Module: ATM Machine
class ATM {
public:
    static void showBalance(BankAccount &account) {
        cout << "Current Balance: $" << account.getBalance() << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount myAccount(500);
    myAccount.deposit(200);
    myAccount.withdraw(100);

    ATM::showBalance(myAccount); // Accessing encapsulated data safely
}
```

## What challenges or pitfalls can you encounter when implementing Encapsulation?

Encapsulation enhances security and modularity, but improper implementation can lead to issues. Here are some common pitfalls:

### 1️. **Overuse of Getters & Setters**
- Excessive use of getters and setters can make code unnecessarily complex.
- If every variable has a getter and setter, encapsulation loses its purpose.

- **Solution:** Only provide accessors (getters/setters) when needed.

### 2️. **Performance Overhead**
- Instead of direct access, function calls add extra processing time.
- This can affect performance in time-sensitive applications.

- **Solution:** Use direct access where encapsulation is unnecessary (e.g., internal methods).

### 3️. **Improper Data Hiding**
- Making too many members public defeats the purpose of encapsulation.
- Poor access control can expose sensitive data.

- **Solution:** Keep critical data private and expose only necessary functionality.

### 4️. **Tightly Coupled Code**
- If classes rely too much on each other's internal data, refactoring becomes difficult.
- High coupling reduces modularity and flexibility.

- **Solution:** Follow **low coupling** and **high cohesion** principles.

### 5️. **Code Readability Issues**
- Excessive encapsulation can make code harder to read.
- Too many access restrictions may cause unnecessary boilerplate code.

- **Solution:** Balance encapsulation and simplicity based on project needs.

## What is Abstraction? Why is it important in software development? What are its key features?

**Abstraction** is an extension of **Encapsulation** that focuses on **hiding implementation details** and exposing only **essential functionalities** to users.

### Alternative Definition:
- Hiding the internal representation of an object. Abstraction is about showing only the necessary details to the user.

**Real Life Example:**
- Watching **cricket on a gadget** – You interact with the interface (play, pause, volume) without knowing the complex hardware and software behind it.


### **Why is Abstraction Important?**
- **Reduces Complexity** – Users only interact with relevant details.
- **Enhances Readability** – Simplifies the understanding of code.
- **Improves Maintainability** – Implementation can change without affecting users.
- **Promotes Reusability** – Common functionality can be shared across different parts of a system.

### Key Features of Abstraction
| Feature                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Hides Unnecessary Details** | Users don't need to know internal workings. |
| **Increases Code Simplicity** | Makes code cleaner and easier to manage. |
| **Implemented Using** | Achieved through **abstract classes** and **interfaces**. |

```cpp
// Abstract class
class Device {
public:
    virtual void turnOn() = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual void turnOff() = 0;
};

// Concrete class
class TV : public Device {
public:
    void turnOn() override {
        cout << "TV is now ON" << endl;
    }
    void turnOff() override {
        cout << "TV is now OFF" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    TV myTV;
    myTV.turnOn();  // Abstracted details, user only sees essential methods
    myTV.turnOff();
}
```
```cpp
class BankAccount {
protected:
    double balance;

public:
    BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    virtual void deposit(double amount) = 0;
    virtual void withdraw(double amount) = 0;
    void showBalance() {
        cout << "Current Balance: $" << balance << endl;
    }
};

// Concrete class
class SavingsAccount : public BankAccount {
public:
    SavingsAccount(double initialBalance) : BankAccount(initialBalance) {}

    void deposit(double amount) override {
        balance += amount;
        cout << "Deposited $" << amount << " successfully." << endl;
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) override {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            cout << "Withdrawn $" << amount << " successfully." << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Insufficient balance!" << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    SavingsAccount myAccount(500);
    myAccount.showBalance();
    myAccount.deposit(200);
    myAccount.withdraw(100);
    myAccount.showBalance();
}
```

```cpp
class PatientRecord {
public:
    virtual void getPatientInfo() = 0;
};

// Concrete class
class Patient : public PatientRecord {
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    string disease;

public:
    Patient(string n, int a, string d) : name(n), age(a), disease(d) {}

    void getPatientInfo() override {
        cout << "Patient Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
        cout << "Disease: " << disease << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Patient p1("John Doe", 35, "Flu");
    p1.getPatientInfo();
}
```

## How does Abstraction differ from Encapsulation?

| Feature          | Encapsulation 🛡️ | Abstraction 🎭 |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Definition** | Hides **data** within an object | Hides **implementation details** |
| **Focus** | **How** data is protected | **What** functionality is provided |
| **Implementation** | Getters & Setters | Abstract Classes & Interfaces |
| **Access Control** | Uses **private/protected** members | Uses **abstract methods** |
| **Main Purpose** | Ensures **data security** and integrity | Reduces **complexity** for users |
| **Real-Life Example** | **Bank Account** (balance is private) | **ATM Machine** (only shows relevant info) |

- **Encapsulation** is about **restricting access** to certain details, ensuring data integrity.
- **Abstraction** is about **hiding complexity**, showing only essential parts to the user.

## What is Inheritance? Explain Its Different Types.

Inheritance is an **OOP feature** that allows a class (**child class**) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (**parent class**).
- It promotes **code reusability** and represents an **"is-a" relationship** between objects.
- The class which is derived is called child or derived or subclass and the class from which the child class is derived is called parent or base or superclass.
- It is also used to achieve Runtime Polymorphism.

### Alternative Definitions:
- **Inheritance** allows classes to inherit **common properties** from a **parent class**.
- It is the process of **one class inheriting** properties and methods from another.
- Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

**Real Life Example:**
1. **Cricket Team** 🏏 – All players inherit **common properties** like:
   - **Dress Code**, **Logo**, **Sponsors**.
2. **Vehicles** 🚗 – A generic vehicle class can be inherited by:
   - **Car, Truck, Bus**, each with additional unique features.

```cpp
// Derived Class syntax
class derived_class_name : access_modifier base_class_name
{
    // body of the derived class
}
```

### **Types of Inheritance**

#### 1. **Single Inheritance**
A child class inherits from one parent class.

##### Alternative Definitions:
- One class inherits from another.
- Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class inherits from only one base class.

```cpp
class ClassA {
    // body of ClassA
};

// derived from ClassA
class ClassB : public ClassA {
    // body of ClassB
};
```
```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Parent class"; }
};
class Child : public Parent { };
```

- We have two classes, `Employee` and `Programmer`. If the `Programmer` class is inherited from the `Employee` class, the `Programmer` class can implement the functionalities of the `Employee` class.

```cpp
// Base class
class Employee {
public:
    string name;
    int id;

    void setEmployeeDetails(string empName, int empId) {
        name = empName;
        id = empId;
    }

    void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        cout << "Employee Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Employee ID: " << id << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Programmer : public Employee {
public:
    string language;

    void setProgrammerDetails(string lang) {
        language = lang;
    }

    void displayProgrammerDetails() {
        displayEmployeeDetails(); // Calling base class method
        cout << "Programming Language: " << language << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Programmer p1;
    p1.setEmployeeDetails("Ahad Ali", 101);
    p1.setProgrammerDetails("C++");
    p1.displayProgrammerDetails();
}
```

#### 2. **Multiple Inheritance**
A class inherits from multiple parent classes.

##### Alternative Definitions:
- A child class inherits from **multiple parent classes**.
- Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited from another derived class.

- For example, we have three classes `ClassA`, `ClassB`, and `ClassC`. If `ClassC` is inherited from both `ClassA` and `ClassB`, it means that `ClassC` can now implement the functionalities of both `ClassA` and `ClassB`. This is multiple inheritance.
```cpp
class ClassA {
    // body of ClassA
};

class ClassB {
    // body of ClassB
};

// derived from ClassA and ClassB
class ClassC : public ClassA, public ClassB {
    // body of ClassC
};
```

```cpp
class A { };
class B { };
class C : public A, public B { }; // Inherits from A & B
```

- For example, we have three classes “Employee”, “Assistant”, and “Programmer”. If the “Programmer” class is inherited from the “Employee” and “Assistant” classes, it means that the “Programmer” class can now implement the functionalities of both the “Employee” and “Assistant” classes.
```cpp
// First Base Class
class Employee {
public:
    string empName;
    int empId;

    void setEmployeeDetails(string name, int id) {
        empName = name;
        empId = id;
    }

    void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        cout << "Employee Name: " << empName << endl;
        cout << "Employee ID: " << empId << endl;
    }
};

// Second Base Class
class Assistant {
public:
    string department;

    void setAssistantDetails(string dept) {
        department = dept;
    }

    void displayAssistantDetails() {
        cout << "Department: " << department << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class (inherits from both Employee and Assistant)
class Programmer : public Employee, public Assistant {
public:
    string language;

    void setProgrammerDetails(string lang) {
        language = lang;
    }

    void displayProgrammerDetails() {
        displayEmployeeDetails(); // Call Employee class method
        displayAssistantDetails(); // Call Assistant class method
        cout << "Programming Language: " << language << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Programmer p1;
    p1.setEmployeeDetails("Ahad Ali", 102);
    p1.setAssistantDetails("IT Department");
    p1.setProgrammerDetails("C++");
    p1.displayProgrammerDetails();
}
```

#### 3. **Multilevel Inheritance**
A derived class becomes a base class for another class.

##### Alternative Definition:
A child class is derived from another derived class.

```cpp
class A { };
class B : public A { };
class C : public B { }; // A → B → C
```

- We have three classes ClassA, ClassB, and ClassC. If ClassB is inherited from ClassA and ClassC is inherited from ClassB, it means that ClassB can now implement the functionalities of ClassA and ClassC can now implement the functionalities of ClassB. This is multilevel inheritance.

```cpp
class ClassA {
    // body of ClassA
};

// derived from ClassA
class ClassB : public ClassA {
    // body of ClassB
};

// derived from ClassB
class ClassC : public ClassB {
    // body of ClassC
};
```

```cpp
// Base Class
class Employee {
public:
    string empName;
    int empId;

    void setEmployeeDetails(string name, int id) {
        empName = name;
        empId = id;
    }

    void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        cout << "Employee Name: " << empName << endl;
        cout << "Employee ID: " << empId << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class (Inheriting from Employee)
class Manager : public Employee {
public:
    string department;

    void setManagerDetails(string dept) {
        department = dept;
    }

    void displayManagerDetails() {
        displayEmployeeDetails(); // Call Employee class method
        cout << "Department: " << department << endl;
    }
};

// Further Derived Class (Inheriting from Manager)
class Director : public Manager {
public:
    string companyStrategy;

    void setDirectorDetails(string strategy) {
        companyStrategy = strategy;
    }

    void displayDirectorDetails() {
        displayManagerDetails(); // Call Manager class method
        cout << "Company Strategy: " << companyStrategy << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Director d1;

    // Setting details for all levels
    d1.setEmployeeDetails("Ahad Ali", 1001);
    d1.setManagerDetails("Software Development");
    d1.setDirectorDetails("Expand Global Presence");

    // Display details at all levels
    d1.displayDirectorDetails();
}
```

#### 4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.

##### Alternative Definitions:
- One parent class has **multiple child classes**.
- Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in which several derived classes are inherited from a single base class.

```cpp
class Parent { };
class Child1 : public Parent { };
class Child2 : public Parent { };
```

We have three classes `ClassA`, `ClassB`, and `ClassC`. If `ClassB` and `ClassC` are inherited from `ClassA`, it means that `ClassB` and `ClassC` can now implement the functionalities of `ClassA`. This is hierarchical inheritance.

```cpp
class ClassA {
    // body of ClassA
};

// derived from ClassA
class ClassB : public ClassA {
    // body of ClassB
};

// derived from ClassA
class ClassC : public ClassA {
    // body of ClassC
};
```

For example, we have three classes “Employee”, “Manager”, and “Programmer”. If the “Programmer” and “Manager” classes are inherited from the “Employee” class, it means that the “Programmer” and “Manager” classes can now implement the functionalities of the “Employee” class.

```cpp
// Base Class
class Employee {
public:
    string empName;
    int empId;

    void setEmployeeDetails(string name, int id) {
        empName = name;
        empId = id;
    }

    void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        cout << "Employee Name: " << empName << endl;
        cout << "Employee ID: " << empId << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class 1 (Inheriting from Employee)
class Manager : public Employee {
public:
    string department;

    void setManagerDetails(string dept) {
        department = dept;
    }

    void displayManagerDetails() {
        displayEmployeeDetails(); // Call Employee class method
        cout << "Department: " << department << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class 2 (Inheriting from Employee)
class Programmer : public Employee {
public:
    string programmingLanguage;

    void setProgrammerDetails(string lang) {
        programmingLanguage = lang;
    }

    void displayProgrammerDetails() {
        displayEmployeeDetails(); // Call Employee class method
        cout << "Programming Language: " << programmingLanguage << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Manager m1;
    Programmer p1;

    // Manager Object
    cout << "Manager Details:\n";
    m1.setEmployeeDetails("Ahad Ali", 1001);
    m1.setManagerDetails("Software Development");
    m1.displayManagerDetails();

    cout << "\n";

    // Programmer Object
    cout << "Programmer Details:\n";
    p1.setEmployeeDetails("Shahan Ali", 1002);
    p1.setProgrammerDetails("C++");
    p1.displayProgrammerDetails();
}
```

#### 5. **Hybrid Inheritance**

A combination of multiple inheritance types.

##### Alternative Definitions:
- Hybrid inheritance is a combination of different types of inheritances.
- A mix of **multiple and hierarchical inheritance**.

```cpp
class A { };
class B : public A { };
class C { };
class D : public B, public C { }; // Hybrid
```

We have four classes `ClassA`, `ClassB`, `ClassC`, and `ClassD`. If `ClassC` is inherited from both `ClassA` and `ClassB`, and `ClassD` is inherited from `ClassC`, it means that `ClassC` can now implement the functionalities of both `ClassA` and `ClassB`, and `ClassD` can now implement the functionalities of `ClassC`. This is multilevel inheritance where both multilevel and multiple inheritances are present.

```cpp
class ClassA {
    // body of ClassA
};

class ClassB {
    // body of ClassB
};

// derived from ClassA and ClassB
class ClassC : public ClassA, public ClassB {
    // body of ClassC
};

// derived from ClassC
class ClassD : public ClassC {
    // body of ClassD
};
```

```cpp
// Base Class
class Employee {
public:
    string empName;
    int empId;

    void setEmployeeDetails(string name, int id) {
        empName = name;
        empId = id;
    }

    void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        cout << "Employee Name: " << empName << endl;
        cout << "Employee ID: " << empId << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class 1 (Hierarchical Inheritance from Employee)
class Manager : public Employee {
public:
    string department;

    void setManagerDetails(string dept) {
        department = dept;
    }

    void displayManagerDetails() {
        displayEmployeeDetails();
        cout << "Department: " << department << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class 2 (Hierarchical Inheritance from Employee)
class Programmer : public Employee {
public:
    string programmingLanguage;

    void setProgrammerDetails(string lang) {
        programmingLanguage = lang;
    }

    void displayProgrammerDetails() {
        displayEmployeeDetails();
        cout << "Programming Language: " << programmingLanguage << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class 3 (Multiple Inheritance from Manager & Programmer)
class TeamLead : public Manager, public Programmer {
public:
    void displayTeamLeadDetails() {
        cout << "Team Lead Details:" << endl;
        Manager::displayEmployeeDetails(); // Avoiding ambiguity
        cout << "Department: " << department << endl;
        cout << "Programming Language: " << programmingLanguage << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    TeamLead t1;

    // Setting details for TeamLead
    t1.Manager::setEmployeeDetails("Abdul Ahad", 2001);
    t1.setManagerDetails("Software Development");
    t1.setProgrammerDetails("C++ and JavaScript");

    // Display TeamLead Details
    t1.displayTeamLeadDetails();
}
```

## What are Access Modifiers in Inheritance?

Access modifiers control the visibility of class members:

- **Public**: Members are accessible from anywhere.
- **Protected**: Members are accessible in derived classes.
- **Private**: Members are not accessible outside the class.

### **Public Access Modifier**

All the variables and functions declared under the `public` access modifier will be available for everyone. They can be accessed both inside and outside the class using the dot (`.`) operator.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    int x;
    void show() {
        cout << "Public Variable: " << x << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base obj;
    obj.x = 10;
    obj.show();
}
```

### **Private Access Modifier**

All the variables and functions declared under a `private` access modifier can only be used inside the class. They are not accessible outside the class.

```cpp
class Base {
private:
    int y;
public:
    void setY(int val) {
        y = val;
    }
    void show() {
        cout << "Private Variable: " << y << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base obj;
    obj.setY(20);
    obj.show();
}
```

### **Protected Access Modifier**

`Protected` access modifiers are similar to `private`, but `protected` members can be accessed in the derived class, whereas `private` members cannot be accessed in derived classes.

```cpp
class Base {
protected:
    int z;
public:
    void setZ(int val) {
        z = val;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Protected Variable: " << z << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.setZ(30);
    obj.show();
}
```

| Access Modifier | Inside Class | Derived Class | Outside Class |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Public**     | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      |
| **Protected**  | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No      |
| **Private**    | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No      | ❌ No      |

## Can a subclass access private members of a superclass? Why or why not?

No, a subclass **cannot** directly access the **private** members of a superclass.

### Why?
- **Encapsulation**: Private members are hidden from outside access, including subclasses.
- **Access Control**: Private members can **only be accessed** within the same class, not by derived classes.

### How to Access Private Members in a Subclass?
- **Through Public or Protected Methods of the Superclass**
- **Using Getter and Setter Methods**

```cpp
class Employee {
private:
    double salary;  // Private member

public:
    Employee(double sal) { salary = sal; }

    // Public method to access private data
    double getSalary() { return salary; }
};

// Derived Class
class Programmer : public Employee {
public:
    Programmer(double sal) : Employee(sal) {}

    void displaySalary() {
        cout << "Salary: " << getSalary() << endl; // Access through public method
    }
};

int main() {
    Programmer p1(50000);
    p1.displaySalary();
}
```

## How does method overriding work in Inheritance?

Method overriding **allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation** of a method that is already defined in the superclass.

- The method in the **subclass** must have the **same name, return type, and parameters** as the method in the **superclass**.
- This helps achieve **polymorphism**, allowing different behaviors for the same method call.

### Rules for Method Overriding
1. The **method in the subclass** must have the **same signature** as the one in the superclass.
2. The method in the **superclass must be `virtual` (in C++)** to allow overriding.
3. Method overriding **only works with inheritance**.
4. If the superclass method is **private**, it **cannot** be overridden.
5. The **access level** of the overridden method in the subclass **cannot be more restrictive** than in the superclass.

#### **Overriding `displayInfo()` in a Derived Class**
##### Scenario: A `Person` class has a method `displayInfo()`. The `Student` class overrides this method.
```cpp
// Base class
class Person {
public:
    virtual void displayInfo() {
        cout << "I am a person." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Student : public Person {
public:
    void displayInfo() override {  // Overriding the base class method
        cout << "I am a student." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person *p;   // Pointer to base class
    Student s;   // Object of derived class
    p = &s;      // Base class pointer pointing to derived class object

    p->displayInfo(); // Calls overridden method in Student class
}

#### **Overriding makeSound() in an Animal Hierarchy**
##### Scenario: Different animals make different sounds.
```cpp
// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        cout << "Some generic animal sound!" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {  // Overriding base class method
        cout << "Woof! Woof!" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {  // Overriding base class method
        cout << "Meow! Meow!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a1 = new Dog();
    Animal* a2 = new Cat();

    a1->makeSound();  // Calls Dog's overridden method
    a2->makeSound();  // Calls Cat's overridden method

    delete a1;
    delete a2;
}
```

#### **Calling the Base Class Method Using scope resolution (::)**
##### Scenario: The subclass method overrides the parent method but also wants to call the base method.
```cpp
// Base class
class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void start() {
        cout << "Vehicle is starting..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void start() override {
        cout << "Car is starting..." << endl;
        Vehicle::start();  // Calling the base class method
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.start();  // Calls overridden method in Car
}
```

## What is the difference between Method Overloading and Method Overriding?

### What is Method Overloading?
Method overloading allows multiple methods **with the same name** but **different parameters** within the same class.
- It is an example of **Compile-time Polymorphism** (also called **Static Binding**).
- The method signature (number or type of parameters) **must be different**.

```cpp
// Method Overloading
class Math {
public:
    // Overloaded methods (Same name, different parameters)
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
};

int main() {
    Math obj;
    cout << "Sum (int): " << obj.add(5, 10) << endl;
    cout << "Sum (double): " << obj.add(3.5, 2.5) << endl;
    cout << "Sum (3 int): " << obj.add(1, 2, 3) << endl;
}
```

### What is Method Overriding?
Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.

- It is an example of **Runtime Polymorphism (also called Dynamic Binding).**
- The method in the subclass must have the same signature as in the superclass.

```cpp
// Method Overriding
// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {  // Virtual function to enable overriding
        cout << "Some generic animal sound!" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {  // Overriding the method
        cout << "Woof! Woof!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    a->makeSound();  // Calls overridden method in Dog
    delete a;
}
```

### Key Differences: Method Overloading vs. Method Overriding

| Feature            | Method Overloading | Method Overriding |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Definition**     | Multiple methods with **same name** but **different parameters** | Subclass redefines a method from the superclass with the **same name and parameters** |
| **Polymorphism**   | Compile-time (Static Binding) | Runtime (Dynamic Binding) |
| **Parameters**     | Must be **different** (different type, number, or order) | Must be **exactly the same** |
| **Return Type**    | Can be different | Must be the same (or covariant) |
| **Scope**          | Within the same class | Between superclass and subclass |
| **Virtual Keyword** | Not required | Required in the superclass for dynamic binding |
| **Function Signature** | Changes (different parameters) | Remains the same |

```cpp
// Method Overloading with Method Overriding
class Parent {
public:
    virtual void show() {  // Virtual function (Overriding)
        cout << "Parent class" << endl;
    }

    void display(int a) {  // Overloaded method
        cout << "Display with int: " << a << endl;
    }

    void display(double a) {  // Overloaded method
        cout << "Display with double: " << a << endl;
    }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    void show() override {  // Overriding show() method
        cout << "Child class" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Child obj;
    obj.show();          // Calls overridden method in Child class
    obj.display(5);      // Calls overloaded method
    obj.display(3.14);   // Calls overloaded method
}
```

## How does Inheritance affect performance?

Excessive inheritance can increase **memory consumption** and **method lookup time** due to **virtual table (vtable) overhead**.

### Performance Impacts of Inheritance:
1. **Increased Memory Usage**
   - Each subclass inherits members from its superclass, increasing object size.
   - Extra pointers for virtual functions consume additional memory.

2. **Method Lookup Overhead (vtable mechanism)**
   - When using **virtual functions**, the program must resolve method calls dynamically.
   - This requires **vtable lookup**, adding a slight performance overhead compared to direct function calls.

3. **Deep Inheritance Chains Can Reduce Efficiency**
   - A long chain of inherited classes increases **complexity** and **indirection**.
   - Accessing a deeply inherited method requires traversing multiple levels in the hierarchy.

4. **Cache Performance Issues**
   - Objects from deeply inherited classes may not be **cache-friendly** due to their larger size.
   - More **cache misses** may occur when accessing class members.

### Optimizing Inheritance for Performance:
- **Prefer Composition over Inheritance** when possible.
- Use **final** keyword for classes or methods that shouldn't be overridden.
- Minimize deep inheritance chains to **reduce indirection**.
- Consider **static binding** instead of dynamic binding where virtual functions are unnecessary.

## What happens if a constructor is not defined in a subclass?

If a constructor is **not defined** in a subclass, the **default constructor** of the **superclass** is called **automatically**.

1. **Superclass Constructor Execution**
   - If a subclass does not explicitly define a constructor, the **default (parameterless) constructor** of the superclass is **automatically** invoked when an object of the subclass is created.

2. **What if the Superclass Has No Default Constructor?**
   - If the superclass has **only parameterized constructors**, the subclass **must explicitly call** a superclass constructor using `super()` (in Java) or `BaseClass()` (in C++), otherwise, it results in a compilation error.

```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    Parent() { cout << "Parent constructor called!" << endl; }
};

class Child : public Parent {
    // No constructor defined in Child, so Parent() is called automatically
};

int main() {
    Child obj; // Output: Parent constructor called!
}
```

## What is Ambiguity in Inheritance? Explain How to Resolve It.

Ambiguity in inheritance occurs in **multiple inheritance** when a method is inherited from more than one parent, causing confusion about which method should be called.

### 🛑 Problem:
When a **derived class** inherits from **multiple base classes**, and those base classes have a method with the **same name**, the compiler gets confused about which method to call.

### ✅ How to Resolve It:
1. **Use the Scope Resolution Operator (`::`)**
   - Specify explicitly which base class function should be called.

2. **Use Virtual Base Classes**
   - Helps avoid redundancy and ambiguity in inheritance.

### 1. **Resolving Ambiguity Using Scope Resolution**
```cpp
class Base1 {
public:
    void greet() {
        cout << "How are you?" << endl;
    }
};

class Base2 {
public:
    void greet() {
        cout << "Kaise ho?" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    void greet() {
        Base2::greet(); // Resolving ambiguity by specifying the base class
    }
};

int main() {
    // Ambiguity demonstration
    Base1 base1obj;
    Base2 base2obj;
    base1obj.greet(); // Output: How are you?
    base2obj.greet(); // Output: Kaise ho?

    Derived d;
    d.greet(); // Output: Kaise ho?
}
```

### 1. **Function Overriding Resolves Ambiguity Automatically**
```cpp
class B {
public:
    void say() {
        cout << "Hello world" << endl;
    }
};

class D : public B {
public:
    // D's new say() method will override base class's say() method
    void say() {
        cout << "Hello my beautiful people" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Ambiguity is automatically resolved due to function overriding
    B b;
    b.say(); // Output: Hello world
    D d;
    d.say(); // Output: Hello my beautiful people
}
```

- **Ambiguity** happens when two base classes have methods with the same name.
- It is resolved using **scope resolution (::) or function overriding**.
- If the **derived class overrides** the method, ambiguity is automatically resolved.
- **Virtual base classes** can be used to prevent ambiguity in complex inheritance structures.

## What is a Virtual Base Class in Inheritance and What Problem Does It Solve?

A **virtual base class** prevents multiple instances of a base class from appearing in the hierarchy, solving the **Diamond Problem**.

A virtual base class is used in **multiple inheritance** to avoid ambiguity when a **common base class** is inherited multiple times through different derived classes.

### **Problem:**

#### Class Structure:
- Class `A` is a **parent class** of classes `B` and `C`.
- Classes `B` and `C` are both **parents** of class `D`.

#### Inheritance Ambiguity:
- When `D` tries to access members of `A`, it **inherits them twice** (once through `B` and once through `C`).
- This **causes ambiguity**, leading to compiler errors.

### Solution: **Virtual Base Class**
- To solve this issue, declare class `A` as a **virtual base class** using the `virtual` keyword.
- This ensures that only **one copy** of `A`'s members is shared among `B` and `C`.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    void say() {
        cout << "Hello world" << endl;
    }
};

class B : public virtual A {
};

class C : public virtual A {
};

class D : public B, public C {
};

int main() {
    D abc;
    abc.say();
}
```

- `A` is marked as **virtual** in both `B` and `C`.
- `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, but **only one copy** of `A` exists.
- **Ambiguity is resolved**, and `abc.say();` works without errors.

---

### Real-World Example: Student, Test, Sports, and Result

#### Class Structure:
- `Student` → Parent class for `Test` and `Sports`.
- `Test` and `Sports` → Parent classes for `Result`.

#### Problem: Ambiguity in Inheritance
- The **data members and methods** of `Student` get **inherited twice** in `Result`.
- When `Result` accesses `Student`, the **compiler gets confused**.

### Solution:**Virtual Base Class**
- Declaring `Student` as **virtual** ensures that **only one copy** of its data members exists.

```cpp
class Student {
protected:
    int roll_no;
public:
    void set_number(int a) {
        roll_no = a;
    }
    void print_number(void) {
        cout << "Your roll no is " << roll_no << endl;
    }
};

class Test : public virtual Student {
protected:
    float maths, physics;
public:
    void set_marks(float m1, float m2) {
        maths = m1;
        physics = m2;
    }
    void print_marks(void) {
        cout << "Your result is here: " << endl
             << "Maths: " << maths << endl
             << "Physics: " << physics << endl;
    }
};

class Sports : public virtual Student {
protected:
    float score;
public:
    void set_score(float sc) {
        score = sc;
    }
    void print_score(void) {
        cout << "Your PT score is " << score << endl;
    }
};

class Result : public Test, public Sports {
private:
    float total;
public:
    void display(void) {
        total = maths + physics + score;
        print_number();
        print_marks();
        print_score();
        cout << "Your total score is: " << total << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Result a;
    a.set_number(4200);
    a.set_marks(78.9, 99.5);
    a.set_score(9);
    a.display();
}
```

- **Ambiguity in multiple inheritance** occurs when a common base class is inherited multiple times.
- **Virtual base classes** ensure that only **one copy** of the base class members exists.
- Use the **`virtual` keyword** in derived classes to prevent redundancy and errors.
- **Virtual inheritance** is useful in complex inheritance structures.

## What is the Diamond Problem and Its Solution?

The **Diamond Problem** occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two base classes that both derive from the same superclass. This leads to **ambiguity** as the compiler cannot determine which instance of the superclass to use.

### **Understanding the Problem**

Consider the following class hierarchy:
- Class `A` is a **base class**.
- Classes `B` and `C` **both inherit from `A`**.
- Class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.

When `D` tries to access a member of `A`, ambiguity arises because `D` inherits two copies of `A` (one from `B` and one from `C`). This leads to **duplicate data members** and **method conflicts**.

```cpp
// Example of the Diamond Problem
class A {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Class A" << endl;
    }
};

class B : public A {};
class C : public A {};

class D : public B, public C {
};

int main() {
    D obj;
    obj.show(); // Ambiguity: Compiler doesn't know which 'show()' to call
}
```

**Problem:**
- `D` has two copies of `A` (one from `B` and one from `C`).
- The compiler gets confused when calling `obj.show()` because it exists in both paths.

### Solution: Using Virtual Base Classes

To solve this, we make `A` a **virtual base class**. This ensures that only **one copy** of `A` exists, no matter how many times it is inherited.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Class A" << endl;
    }
};

class B : virtual public A {};
class C : virtual public A {};

class D : public B, public C {
};

int main() {
    D obj;
    obj.show(); // No ambiguity, only one copy of A exists
    return 0;
}
```

### How Virtual Base Classes Fix the Problem:
- `virtual` ensures `A` is inherited **only once**, even though both `B` and `C` inherit from it.
- This removes ambiguity and saves memory by preventing duplicate copies of `A` in `D`.

### Key Points:
- **Diamond Problem** happens when multiple inheritance causes duplicate base class instances.
- **Virtual base classes** ensure only one copy of the common base class exists.
- **Ambiguity is resolved**, allowing correct method calls.

## What is Polymorphism? Why is it important in software development?

“Polymorphism” means having many forms.

**Polymorphism** means having many forms. It is the ability of a function, object, or method to behave differently based on the context.

- The word "polymorphism" comes from Greek, meaning **"many forms."**
- We can define multiple functions having the same name but different working depending on the context.
- It enhances **code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability**.

### Alternative Definitions:
- It is the property of some code to behave differently for different contexts.
- Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, promoting flexibility and code reuse.
- Polymorphism in C++ enables the ability to call different methods through the same interface, promoting flexible and reusable code.

- Polymorphism allows different implementations of the same functionality, often using **inheritance** and **virtual functions**.

- **Inheritance**: Allows derived classes to inherit and override methods from the base class.
- **Virtual Functions**: Enable different implementations for methods in derived classes while maintaining a common interface in the base class.

- **Virtual Functions**: Allow derived classes to override base class methods for dynamic behavior.
- **Dynamic Method Binding**: Ensures that the correct method is executed based on the actual type of the object at runtime.

**Real Life Example:**
Think of **MS Dhoni** in cricket:
- As a **Captain**, he makes strategic decisions.
- As a **Keeper**, he does wicket-keeping.
- As a **Batsman**, he scores runs.

### Why is Polymorphism Important?
- **Enhances Code Reusability**: Allows using a common interface for different data types.
- **Improves Maintainability**: Reduces code duplication.
- **Supports Extensibility**: New functionalities can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Encourages Flexibility**: Enables different implementations of the same interface.

## What are the Types of Polymorphism?

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism**: Function overloading, operator overloading.
2. **Run-time Polymorphism**: Function overriding via virtual functions.

### 1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)**

Also known as **function overloading** or **operator overloading**.
- The function to be executed is determined at compile-time.
- This is achieved using **function overloading** and **operator overloading**.
- Resolved during **compilation**, meaning the compiler determines which function to execute.

    - **Function Overloading**: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists.
    - **Operator Overloading**: Custom behavior for operators (`+`, `-`, etc.) for user-defined types.

```cpp
// Function Overloading
class Math {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};
int main() {
    Math obj;
    cout << obj.add(2, 3) << endl;       // Calls int add(int, int)
    cout << obj.add(2.5, 3.5) << endl;   // Calls double add(double, double)
}
```

### 2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)**

Also known as **method overriding**.
- The function to be executed is determined at runtime.
- Achieved using **inheritance and virtual functions**.
- Resolved at **runtime**, enabling dynamic behavior based on the actual type of the object.

This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding. Late binding and dynamic polymorphism are other names for runtime polymorphism. The function call is resolved at runtime in runtime polymorphism. In contrast, with compile time polymorphism, the compiler determines which function call to bind to the object after deducing it at runtime.

- **Virtual Functions**: Methods in the base class that can be overridden in derived classes. The function executed depends on the actual object type, not the pointer type.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() {
        cout << "Animal speaks" << endl;
    }
};
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Animal* obj = new Dog();
    obj->speak(); // Calls Dog's speak() due to runtime polymorphism
    delete obj;
}
```

## What is the Difference between Compile-time vs Run-time Polymorphism?

| Feature                | Compile-time Polymorphism | Run-time Polymorphism |
|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Binding Time**       | Compile-time            | Run-time            |
| **Function Type**      | Overloading, Operator Overloading | Function Overriding |
| **Speed**             | Faster                   | Slightly slower (due to vtables) |
| **Implementation**     | Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters | Virtual functions in a base class overridden in derived classes |
| **Flexibility**        | Less flexible            | More flexible |

- **Compile-time polymorphism** is determined during compilation and is **faster**.
- **Run-time polymorphism** is resolved during execution and provides **dynamic behavior**.
- **Virtual functions** play a crucial role in enabling **method overriding**.

## What is the Difference between Static Binding (Early Binding) vs Dynamic Binding (Late Binding)?

| Feature                | Static Binding (Early Binding)    | Dynamic Binding (Late Binding)    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Binding Time**        | Resolved at compile time          | Resolved at runtime               |
| **Method Resolution**   | Methods are resolved at compile-time | Methods are resolved at runtime    |
| **Efficiency**          | Faster                            | Slower due to virtual table lookup |
| **Usage**               | Typically used in non-virtual functions | Required for virtual functions   |
| **Flexibility**         | Less flexible                     | More flexible, allows method overriding |

- **Static Binding** is faster as the method is determined at compile time.
- **Dynamic Binding** provides more flexibility by resolving the method at runtime, enabling **method overriding**.
- **Virtual functions** are essential for **dynamic binding** to work.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What is Function Overriding?

Function Overriding is when a subclass provides a new implementation of an inherited method with the same signature as in the parent class.

- It occurs when a derived class has a definition for a member function that was already defined in the base class. This allows the derived class to **replace** the behavior of the base class method.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    // Base class function
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Function overriding in derived class
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;
    Dog dog;
    animalPtr = &dog;

    // Function call resolved at runtime (Polymorphism)
    animalPtr->sound(); // Output: Dog barks
}
```

#### **Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members**
In C++, Runtime Polymorphism cannot be achieved with data members because data members are not resolved at runtime, unlike methods (functions) that can be dynamically bound.

Let’s look at an example where we access a field by reference to the base class, which refers to the instance of the derived class:
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    string name = "Animal";  // Data member
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    string name = "Dog";  // Overriding the data member
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;
    Dog dog;
    animalPtr = &dog;

    // Accessing the base class data member via reference
    cout << "Animal name: " << animalPtr->name << endl; // Output: Animal name: Animal
}
```

- Both **Animal and Dog** have a name data member.
- When accessing name via the base class pointer, it will always refer to the Animal class’s data member, even if the object is actually of the derived class Dog.
- This is because **data members** cannot be dynamically resolved like methods; hence, **polymorphism** does not work for them.

- **Function Overriding** allows methods to be redefined in **derived classes and resolves at runtime**.
- **Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members** is not possible because data members are not part of **dynamic binding**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## How does Polymorphism promote code reusability and flexibility?

Polymorphism allows for a single interface to be used for different types, enabling code to be **extensible** and **reusable**. With polymorphism, we can write more generic and reusable code by working with parent class references/pointers and calling overridden methods in derived classes.

- This means the same function or method call can behave differently depending on the object’s actual class, providing greater flexibility.

### Benefits of Polymorphism:
- **Code Reusability:** You can use the same interface for different object types without rewriting the code for each type.
- **Flexibility:** Polymorphism makes it easier to extend and maintain code. New classes can be introduced without changing the existing codebase, following the open/closed principle.
- **Simplified Code Maintenance:** Changes to base class methods are automatically reflected in derived classes, minimizing the need for extensive modifications.

```cpp
// Demonstrating Code Reusability and Flexibility
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        cout << "Drawing a shape" << endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a Circle" << endl;
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a Square" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating a vector of Shape pointers
    vector<Shape*> shapes;

    // Adding different shapes to the vector
    shapes.push_back(new Circle());
    shapes.push_back(new Square());

    // Using polymorphism to call the appropriate draw() method
    for (Shape* shape : shapes) {
        shape->draw();  // Each shape's draw method is called dynamically
    }

    // Cleanup
    for (Shape* shape : shapes) {
        delete shape;
    }
}
```

- In the above code, we define a **Shape class** with a **draw()** method.
- Both **Circle and Square** inherit from **Shape** and override the **draw()** method.
- By using **polymorphism**, the same draw() function call behaves differently based on the actual object type (Circle or Square) stored in the shapes vector.
- This approach demonstrates how **polymorphism enables code reusability** (using the same interface for different shapes) and flexibility (easily adding new shapes without modifying existing code).

## What method makes classes exhibit different behavior in polymorphism?

**Virtual functions** allow derived classes to override base class methods, enabling polymorphism. When a function is marked as `virtual` in the base class, it can be overridden in derived classes, allowing different behavior based on the object type at runtime.

### Key Points About Virtual Functions:
- **Dynamic Behavior:** Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism, where the correct function is called depending on the object type at runtime.
- **Keyword:** They are declared with the keyword `virtual` in the base class.
- **Overridden in Derived Classes:** Virtual functions are redefined (overridden) in derived classes to provide specific behavior.
- **Runtime Binding:** Virtual functions are resolved at runtime, allowing dynamic method invocation based on the actual object type.

```cpp
// Demonstrating Virtual Functions
class Animal {
public:
    // Virtual function in the base class
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Overriding the virtual function in the derived class
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    // Overriding the virtual function in the derived class
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Cat meows" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;
    Dog dog;
    Cat cat;

    // Base class pointer can point to derived class objects
    animalPtr = &dog;
    animalPtr->sound();  // Output: Dog barks

    animalPtr = &cat;
    animalPtr->sound();  // Output: Cat meows
}
```

- The **sound()** method is declared as `virtual` in the base class Animal.
- Both **Dog and Cat** classes override the **sound()** method to provide their specific implementations.
- The base class pointer **animalPtr** points to objects of the derived classes Dog and Cat.
- When the **sound()** method is called, the appropriate version (based on the object type) is invoked at runtime, demonstrating runtime polymorphism.

- **Virtual functions** make it possible for derived classes to provide their own implementation of a base class method.
- The use of the `virtual keyword` ensures that the correct method is called based on the actual object type during execution (runtime).
- **Runtime polymorphism** is a powerful concept in **object-oriented programming**, made possible by virtual functions.

## What is a Pointer to a Derived Class and Its Purpose?

A **pointer to a derived class** allows polymorphic behavior when assigned to a base class pointer. It ensures dynamic method resolution at runtime, allowing the appropriate method to be called when a base class pointer points to a derived class object.

- **Late Binding**: The compiler determines the method to execute based on the actual object type at runtime.
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Achieved when virtual functions in the base class are overridden by derived class methods.

```cpp
// Demonstrating Pointers to Derived Class

// Base Class
class Base {
public:
    int var = 10;
    virtual void display() {
        cout << "Base class variable: " << var << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    int var2 = 20;
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived class variable: " << var2 << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Base class pointer pointing to a Derived class object
    Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;
    basePtr = &derivedObj;

    // Calls the derived class method due to late binding
    basePtr->display();

    // Derived class pointer
    Derived* derivedPtr = &derivedObj;
    derivedPtr->var2 = 30;
    derivedPtr->display();
}

// Output:
Derived class variable: 20
Derived class variable: 30
```

### Base Class Pointers

- Can access only **inherited members** of the derived class.
- Cannot directly access new members or methods defined in the derived class.

### Derived Class Pointers

- Can access:
  1. **Inherited members** from the base class.
  2. **New members or methods** defined in the derived class.

```cpp
// Base Class
class Base {
public:
    int baseVar = 10;  // Base class member

    void displayBase() {
        cout << "Base class variable: " << baseVar << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    int derivedVar = 20;  // Derived class member

    void displayDerived() {
        cout << "Derived class variable: " << derivedVar << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Base class pointer pointing to a Derived class object
    Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;

    basePtr = &derivedObj;

    // Accessing inherited member through base class pointer
    basePtr->baseVar = 15;  // Allowed
    basePtr->displayBase(); // Allowed

    // basePtr->derivedVar = 25; // Error: Cannot access derived class members
    // basePtr->displayDerived(); // Error: Cannot access derived class methods

    // Derived class pointer
    Derived* derivedPtr = &derivedObj;

    // Accessing both base and derived members through derived class pointer
    derivedPtr->baseVar = 30;       // Allowed
    derivedPtr->derivedVar = 40;    // Allowed
    derivedPtr->displayBase();      // Allowed
    derivedPtr->displayDerived();   // Allowed
}
```

```cpp
// Polymorphism with Virtual Functions
class CWH{
    protected:
        string title;
        float rating;
    public:
        CWH(string s, float r){
            title =  s;
            rating = r;
        }
        virtual void display(){}
};

class CWHVideo: public CWH
{
    float videoLength;
    public:
        CWHVideo(string s, float r, float vl): CWH(s, r){
            videoLength = vl;
        }
        void display(){
            cout<<"This is an amazing video with title "<<title<<endl;
            cout<<"Ratings: "<<rating<<" out of 5 stars"<<endl;
            cout<<"Length of this video is: "<<videoLength<<" minutes"<<endl;
        }
};

class CWHText: public CWH
{
    int words;
    public:
        CWHText(string s, float r, int wc): CWH(s, r){
            words = wc;
        }
     void display(){
      cout<<"This is an amazing text tutorial with title "<<title<<endl;
      cout<<"Ratings of this text tutorial: "<<rating<<" out of 5 stars"<<endl;
      cout<<"No of words in this text tutorial is: "<<words<<" words"<<endl;
         }
};

int main(){
    string title;
    float rating, vlen;
    int words;

    title = "Django tutorial";
    vlen = 4.56;
    rating = 4.89;
    CWHVideo djVideo(title, rating, vlen);

    title = "Django tutorial Text";
    words = 433;
    rating = 4.19;
    CWHText djText(title, rating, words);

    CWH* tuts[2];
    tuts[0] = &djVideo;
    tuts[1] = &djText;

    tuts[0]->display();
    tuts[1]->display();
}
```

- **CWH** is the base class with a `virtual display()` function.
- **CWHVideo** and **CWHText** override the `display()` method to show details specific to their types.
- **Polymorphism** is achieved through base class pointers, where the appropriate `display()` method is called based on the object type at runtime.

## What is the Rule of Three?

The **Rule of Three** in C++ states that if a class needs to define one of the following three special member functions, it likely needs to define all three to manage resource ownership properly:

1. **Destructor**
2. **Copy Constructor**
3. **Copy Assignment Operator**

These functions are necessary when your class involves **dynamic memory management** or resources that need proper copying and cleaning up.

### Why Does It Matter?

If a class allocates resources (like memory, file handles, network connections, etc.), it's important to manage those resources properly when:
- **Copying objects**: Ensuring a deep copy is made rather than a shallow copy.
- **Destroying objects**: Ensuring resources are released when an object goes out of scope.
- **Assigning objects**: Properly copying resources when one object is assigned to another.

Without proper handling, you might run into issues like **double deletion** (deleting the same resource multiple times), **memory leaks**, or **undefined behavior**.

### The Three Special Functions:

#### 1. Destructor:
The destructor is used to clean up resources when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        ptr = new int(5);  // Dynamically allocating memory
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        delete ptr;  // Deleting the dynamically allocated memory
    }
private:
    int* ptr;
};
```

#### 2. Copy Constructor:
- The copy constructor is called when an object is passed by value or returned by value, and it ensures a deep copy of the resources rather than a shallow copy.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        ptr = new int(*(other.ptr));  // Deep copy of the resource
    }
private:
    int* ptr;
};
```

#### 3. Copy Assignment Operator:
- The copy assignment operator is used when an object is assigned to another existing object. It ensures proper cleanup and deep copying.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) {  // Check for self-assignment
            delete ptr;  // Delete existing resource
            ptr = new int(*(other.ptr));  // Deep copy of the resource
        }
        return *this;
    }
private:
    int* ptr;
};
```

```cpp
// Demonstrating the Rule of Three Completely
class MyClass {
private:
    int* ptr;

public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(int value) {
        ptr = new int(value);
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete ptr;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        ptr = new int(*(other.ptr));  // Deep copy of resource
    }

    // Copy Assignment Operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) {  // Prevent self-assignment
            delete ptr;  // Free existing resource
            ptr = new int(*(other.ptr));  // Deep copy of resource
        }
        return *this;
    }

    void show() const {
        cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(42);  // Constructor called
    MyClass obj2 = obj1;  // Copy constructor called
    MyClass obj3(0);
    obj3 = obj1;  // Copy assignment operator called

    obj1.show();
    obj2.show();
    obj3.show();
}
```

## Can we override a static method? Why or why not?

No, **static methods** cannot be overridden.

### Why?
- **Static Methods** belong to the **class** itself, not to any instance of the class. They are **not bound to a specific object** at runtime, which is why they cannot take advantage of **runtime polymorphism**.
- **Overriding** in object-oriented programming allows a **derived class** to provide its own implementation of a **virtual method** that was declared in the **base class**. Since static methods are **not virtual**, they do not participate in polymorphism.
- In the case of a static method, the method belongs to the class and is called using the class name (not an instance), which prevents the dynamic dispatch mechanism required for method overriding.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    static void show() {
        cout << "Base class static method" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    static void show() {  // This is a static method, not an override
        cout << "Derived class static method" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base::show();   // Calls Base class static method
    Derived::show();  // Calls Derived class static method
}
```

- In the example above, we are hiding the static method of the base class in the derived class, but not overriding it. Each class's static method is called based on the class name, not on the object. Therefore, it's important to note that this is method hiding, not overriding.

- **Static methods** are bound to the class itself, not instances, and therefore cannot be overridden.
- They can be **redeclared in derived classes**, but this is known as method hiding.

## What is a Virtual Function and Its Purpose?

A **virtual function** is a member function in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes. The `virtual` keyword allows derived classes to provide their own implementation of the function, enabling **run-time polymorphism**.

### Purpose of Virtual Functions:
- Ensures the correct function is called for an object, regardless of how the object is referenced (pointer or reference).
- Promotes flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented design.

Virtual functions are primarily used to achieve **runtime polymorphism**. The function that gets called is determined at runtime, based on the actual object type, not the type of reference or pointer.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What are the Rules for Virtual Functions?

1. **Cannot be static**: Virtual functions are associated with instances of a class, not with the class itself. Therefore, they cannot be static.
2. **Must be accessed via pointers or references**: Virtual functions are intended to be called on pointers or references to the base class, enabling polymorphism.
3. **Can be a friend of another class**: A virtual function can be declared as a friend of another class to allow access to its private members.
4. **Override is optional in derived classes**: Derived classes can override a virtual function, but it's not mandatory. If the derived class does not provide its own implementation, the base class version is used.
5. **Default behavior is inherited if not overridden**: If the virtual function is not overridden in the derived class, the base class implementation is used by default.
6. **Must be defined in the base class**: Virtual functions should be defined in the base class with the `virtual` keyword to indicate that they can be overridden.
7. **Same function signature in derived classes**: The function signature must be the same in both the base class and the derived class to ensure consistency.
8. **Virtual destructor is recommended**: A class with virtual functions should ideally have a virtual destructor to ensure proper cleanup of resources when objects are deleted through base class pointers.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Can Virtual Functions be Private?

Yes, a **virtual function can be private** in C++.
However, **access control** in C++ does not affect **visibility for function overriding**.

- A **derived class can override a private virtual function** of the base class.
- The **base class controls when and how the virtual function is called**.
- Even if the function is `private` in the derived class, **it will still be invoked via polymorphism**.

1. **Private virtual functions are inherited** and **overridden**, but they can only be called by **base class methods**.
2. **A derived class can override a private virtual function**, but it **cannot call it directly**.
3. **Polymorphism works**, even if the overridden function is `private` in the derived class.

```cpp
// Base class
class Base {
public:
    // Constructor
    Base() { cout << "Base class constructor\n"; }

    // Virtual destructor (always recommended in polymorphic base classes)
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base class destructor\n"; }

    // Public method in Base
    void show() { cout << "show() called on Base class\n"; }

    // Public virtual function in Base
    virtual void print() {
        cout << "print() called on Base class\n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Constructor
    Derived() : Base() {
        cout << "Derived class constructor\n";
    }

    // Virtual destructor
    virtual ~Derived() {
        cout << "Derived class destructor\n";
    }

private:
    // Private virtual function in Derived
    virtual void print() override {
        cout << "print() called on Derived class\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Printing with base class pointer\n";

    // Base class pointer pointing to Derived class object
    Base* basePtr = new Derived();

    // Call public function from Base
    basePtr->show();

    // Call virtual function (private in Derived)
    basePtr->print();

    delete basePtr;
}
```

### Why Does This Work?

- The `print()` function is **declared public in the base class** but **overridden as private in the derived class**.
- The function is still accessible **through the base class pointer** because function calls are resolved at **runtime using virtual table (vtable)**.
- **Even though `print()` is private in `Derived`**, the base class **already defined the interface**, so the function **is still accessible through polymorphism**.

### Real-World Use Cases

1. **Encapsulation & Controlled Access**
- If you **only want the base class** to control the function call, you can make the derived class override it privately.

2. **Design Patterns (Template Method)**
- Base class defines a **public method** that internally calls a **private virtual function**, ensuring **controlled extension**.

3. **Security & Restricted Overrides**
- Prevents **accidental function calls** in derived classes while still enforcing implementation.

## What are inline virtual functions? Are inline virtual functions really nonsense?

**Inline virtual functions** are rare and often not useful because **virtual functions** require a **vtable lookup**, which negates the benefits of inlining.

- I received a code review comment saying that virtual functions need not be inline, which made me question the usefulness of inline virtual functions. Initially, I thought they could come in handy in scenarios where functions are called directly on objects. However, I soon realized that if a function is virtual, it will be dispatched dynamically, and calling it on an object would bypass the typical inlining mechanism.

### The Counter-Argument:

If a function is **virtual**, it typically requires dynamic dispatch (i.e., the program needs to look up the appropriate function in the **vtable**). This lookup is a **runtime overhead**, which means that the compiler cannot predict the correct function to call at compile-time, which is a key requirement for inlining to be effective. Therefore, making a virtual function inline is usually not beneficial.

### Should Inline Virtual Functions Be Used?

It is generally **not recommended** to use inline virtual functions because they are almost never expanded in practice. The vtable lookup makes it difficult for the compiler to statically determine which function to call at compile-time, and thus, it prevents the function from being inlined in most scenarios.

```cpp
class Temp {
public:
    virtual ~Temp() {}

    virtual void myVirtualFunction() const {
        cout << "Temp::myVirtualFunction" << endl;
    }
};

class TempDerived : public Temp {
public:
    void myVirtualFunction() const override {
        cout << "TempDerived::myVirtualFunction" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    TempDerived aDerivedObj;
    // Compiler thinks it's safe to expand the virtual functions
    aDerivedObj.myVirtualFunction();  // Direct call, but it's still virtual

    // Type of object Temp points to is always known;
    // Does the compiler still expand virtual functions?
    // I doubt the compiler would be that intelligent!
    Temp* pTemp = &aDerivedObj;
    pTemp->myVirtualFunction();  // Virtual call, still requires vtable lookup
}
```

- Direct Call `(aDerivedObj.myVirtualFunction();)`: Even though this is a direct call to the derived class's method, the method is still virtual, so the compiler typically won’t inline it due to the need for the vtable lookup.
- Indirect Call `(pTemp->myVirtualFunction();)`: This is a classic case of runtime polymorphism. The compiler cannot predict which method to call since pTemp could point to any derived class object, and thus the method call will go through the vtable at runtime.

- **Inline virtual functions** are not really useful in most cases because of the dynamic dispatch overhead (vtable lookup).
- It’s best to avoid marking **virtual functions as inline**, as they rarely get inlined anyway due to the runtime resolution needed for polymorphism.
- Inlining is a **compile-time optimization**, but virtual functions require runtime dispatch, making inlining ineffective in most use cases.

## What is a Pure Virtual Function, Its Purpose, and an Abstract Base Class?

A **pure virtual function** is a virtual function declared in a base class and assigned `= 0`, meaning it has no implementation in the base class.

- It serves as a placeholder, ensuring that derived classes provide their own implementation.
- Declaring at least one pure virtual function in a class makes it an **abstract base class**, preventing instantiation.

```cpp
virtual void display() = 0;
```

### Abstract Base Class
An **abstract base class** contains at least one pure virtual function:

- **Cannot be instantiated** (objects cannot be created directly from the class).
- **Derived classes** must override all pure virtual functions; otherwise, a **compilation error** occurs.

```cpp
// (Implementing a Pure Virtual Function in an Abstract Base Class) or Abstract base class with a pure virtual function
class CWH {
protected:
    string title;
    float rating;

public:
    CWH(string s, float r) : title(s), rating(r) {}

    virtual void display() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

// Derived class for video tutorials
class CWHVideo : public CWH {
    float videoLength;

public:
    CWHVideo(string s, float r, float vl) : CWH(s, r), videoLength(vl) {}

    void display() {
        cout << "This is an amazing video with title \"" << title << "\"" << endl;
        cout << "Ratings: " << rating << " out of 5 stars" << endl;
        cout << "Length of this video: " << videoLength << " minutes" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class for text tutorials
class CWHText : public CWH {
    int words;

public:
    CWHText(string s, float r, int wc) : CWH(s, r), words(wc) {}

    void display() {
        cout << "This is an amazing text tutorial with title \"" << title << "\"" << endl;
        cout << "Ratings: " << rating << " out of 5 stars" << endl;
        cout << "Number of words: " << words << " words" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Video tutorial
    string title = "Django Tutorial";
    float rating = 4.89, videoLength = 4.56;
    CWHVideo djVideo(title, rating, videoLength);

    // Text tutorial
    title = "Django Text Tutorial";
    int words = 433;
    rating = 4.19;
    CWHText djText(title, rating, words);

    // Pointer array to base class objects
    CWH* tutorials[2];
    tutorials[0] = &djVideo;
    tutorials[1] = &djText;

    // Display information using pointers
    tutorials[0]->display();
    tutorials[1]->display();
}
```

## What is a Pure Abstract Base Class?

A **pure abstract base class** is a class that contains **only pure virtual functions** and **no data members**.

- A **pure abstract base class** acts as a **strict interface** that all derived classes must implement.
- It **cannot be instantiated** (objects cannot be created from this class).
- Every derived class **must** provide its own implementation for all pure virtual functions.

```cpp
class Interface {
public:
    virtual void method1() = 0;
    virtual void method2() = 0;
};
```

**Things about it:**
- Contains only pure virtual functions (= 0).
- Does not have data members or implemented methods.
- Serves as a strict contract that derived classes must follow.
- Encourages polymorphism and interface-based design.

### Why Use a Pure Abstract Base Class?
1. Encapsulation of Behavior**
- Defines a standard set of behaviors that all derived classes must implement.

2. Polymorphism**
- Enables dynamic method dispatch, allowing objects to be manipulated through a base class pointer.

3. **Loose Coupling**
- Reduces dependencies by separating interface from implementation.

4. **Enforcing a Contract**
- Ensures that all derived classes must follow the defined methods.

```cpp
// Pure Abstract Base Class (Interface)
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual double area() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

// Derived Class: Circle
class Circle : public Shape {
    double radius;

public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
    }

    double area() override {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
};

// Derived Class: Rectangle
class Rectangle : public Shape {
    double width, height;

public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {}

    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << endl;
    }

    double area() override {
        return width * height;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* s1 = new Circle(5);
    Shape* s2 = new Rectangle(4, 6);

    s1->draw();
    cout << "Area: " << s1->area() << endl;

    s2->draw();
    cout << "Area: " << s2->area() << endl;

    delete s1;
    delete s2;
}
```

## Why Does a Pure Virtual Function Require a Function Body?

A **pure virtual function** usually has **no definition** in the base class, but a **pure virtual destructor must have a function body**.

### **Reason:**
- **Destructors are not overridden** like regular virtual functions.
- **Destruction happens in reverse order** of class derivation.
- The **derived class destructor runs first**, followed by the **base class destructor**.
- If the **pure virtual destructor** has no definition, **what function will the base class call during destruction?**
- To avoid **undefined behavior**, the compiler **requires a function body** for pure virtual destructors.

```cpp
// Base class with a pure virtual destructor
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = 0; // Pure virtual destructor
};

// Definition of the pure virtual destructor
Base::~Base() { cout << "~Base() is executed\n"; }

// Derived class
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { cout << "~Derived() is executed\n"; }
};

// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Base class pointer pointing to derived class
    Base* b = new Derived();
    delete b; // Proper destructor call
}
```

- **Destructors must always be callable**, so a pure virtual destructor **must have a definition**.
- The **base class destructor is still executed**, even if declared pure virtual.
- **Deleting a derived object via a base class pointer ensures proper cleanup.**
- Helps enforce **proper inheritance hierarchy and polymorphic destruction**.

## What is the Difference between Virtual vs Pure Virtual Function?

| Feature            | Virtual Function                                      | Pure Virtual Function                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Defined in base class with a default implementation. | Declared in base class with `= 0`, no implementation. |
| **Overriding**     | Can be overridden but **not required**.             | **Must** be overridden in the derived class.  |
| **Base Class Object** | You can create objects of the base class.         | Base class becomes **abstract**; cannot create objects. |
| **Usage**         | Provides polymorphism with a default behavior.       | Enforces implementation in derived classes. |

### When to Use What?
- Use a **virtual function** when you want **optional overriding** with a default behavior.
- Use a **pure virtual function** when you want to **force** the derived class to implement it.

## Can a Constructor be Virtual?

No, constructors cannot be virtual because **vtables** (virtual tables) are set up **after** the object is constructed.

### Explanation:
A constructor is responsible for initializing an object, and at the time of construction, the object itself has not yet been fully created. The **virtual table (vtable)**, which is used for dynamic dispatch of virtual functions, is created after the object is fully constructed. Since the constructor is responsible for initializing the object, it cannot rely on the virtual mechanism, as the vtable is not in place yet.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    // Attempting to make a constructor virtual
    // This will result in a compile-time error
    virtual Base() {
        cout << "Base Constructor" << endl;
    }
    virtual void display() {
        cout << "Base display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Derived class constructor
    Derived() {
        cout << "Derived Constructor" << endl;
    }

    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived display" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* b = new Derived(); // This will result in a compile-time error due to virtual constructor
    b->display();  // Calls Derived's display()
    delete b;
}
```

- **Constructors cannot be virtual** because the virtual table is not set up until after the constructor finishes.
- The compiler will throw an error if you attempt to declare a**constructor as virtual**, as shown in the example.

---

## Can a Constructor be Pure Virtual?

No, constructors cannot be pure virtual because constructors are responsible for creating an object, and a pure virtual function requires a derived class to implement it. A constructor is part of the object creation process and cannot be skipped or left unimplemented.

However, a class **can** have a pure virtual function, which forces any derived class to provide an implementation for that function.

- **Pure virtual functions** are meant to be overridden by derived classes. These functions do not have a body and are declared by assigning `= 0` at the end of their declaration. This marks the function as pure virtual, making the class abstract.
- **Constructors**, on the other hand, cannot be pure virtual because they are essential to the creation of objects, and leaving a constructor unimplemented would make it impossible to create instances of the class, even in derived classes.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    // Pure virtual function
    virtual void display() = 0;

    // Constructor (cannot be pure virtual)
    Base() {
        cout << "Base Constructor" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Override the pure virtual function
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived display" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Base b;  // This would result in a compile-time error, as Base is abstract
    Derived d;
    d.display();  // Calls Derived's display()
}
```

- **Constructors** cannot be pure virtual, as they are required to create instances of objects.
- A class can have **pure virtual functions**, which enforce that derived classes must implement those functions, making the class abstract and uninstantiable.

## What is a Virtual Destructor?

A **virtual destructor** is a destructor marked as `virtual` in a base class to ensure that the destructors of derived classes are called correctly when deleting objects through base class pointers.

### Why Use Virtual Destructors?
- When deleting an object through a base class pointer, it ensures that the destructor of the correct derived class is invoked, preventing memory leaks.
- Without a virtual destructor in the base class, only the base class destructor will be called, potentially leaving derived class resources unreleased.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor" << endl; } // Virtual Destructor
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived();
    delete basePtr; // Ensures Derived's destructor is called first, then Base's.
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is a Pure Virtual Destructor?

A pure virtual destructor is a destructor that is declared as pure virtual in a class, forcing derived classes to implement it while still allowing the destruction of the base class itself.

### Key Characteristics:
- A class with a pure virtual destructor cannot be instantiated.
- Even though it is pure virtual, the pure virtual destructor **must still have a definition in the base class**.

### Why Define a Pure Virtual Destructor?
- To prevent instantiating the base class and force derived classes to provide specific destructor behavior while ensuring the base class can still properly clean up resources.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = 0;  // Pure virtual destructor
};

// Definition of pure virtual destructor
Base::~Base() {
    cout << "Base Destructor" << endl;
}

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() override {
        cout << "Derived Destructor" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived();
    delete basePtr; // Calls Derived's destructor, then Base's.
}
```

---

## Can a Destructor be Virtual? Why and When to use virtual destructors?

Yes, a destructor can be virtual in C++ to ensure proper cleanup when an object of a derived class is deleted via a base class pointer. This ensures that the destructors of all derived classes are called in the correct order, avoiding resource leaks.

### Why Make a Destructor Virtual?
- When an object of a derived class is deleted through a base class pointer, the virtual destructor ensures that the destructor of the derived class is called before the base class destructor.
- This avoids resource leaks by properly cleaning up the memory and other resources allocated by the derived class.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {  // Virtual destructor
        cout << "Base Destructor" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() override {
        cout << "Derived Destructor" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived();
    delete basePtr;  // Calls Derived's destructor, then Base's destructor.
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## Can a Destructor be Pure Virtual?

Yes, a destructor can be pure virtual in C++ to prevent instantiating the base class and force derived classes to implement their own destructors. However, it must still have a definition in the base class, because destructors are always called when an object is destroyed.

- Even though the destructor is pure virtual, it still requires a definition to allow proper destruction of objects.
- This is important in cases where you want to define the base class as abstract but still ensure it has the necessary destructor behavior.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = 0;  // Pure virtual destructor
    // Definition of pure virtual destructor
    virtual void cleanup() { cout << "Base cleanup" << endl; }
};

Base::~Base() {
    cout << "Base Destructor" << endl;
}

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() override {
        cout << "Derived Destructor" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived();
    delete basePtr;  // Calls Derived's destructor, then Base's destructor.
}
```

**Why Define a Pure Virtual Destructor?**
- It prevents creating objects of the base class directly.
- It forces derived classes to implement their own destructor while still allowing the base class to clean up any necessary resources.

You should use **virtual destructors** when you're working with **polymorphism** and expect to delete derived class objects through a base class pointer. This ensures that the destructor of the derived class gets called properly, and resources are cleaned up correctly.

### Why Virtual Destructors Are Important:
When you delete a derived class object using a base class pointer, if the base class’s destructor isn’t virtual, only the base class destructor will be called. This can cause memory or resource leaks because the derived class's destructor (which may handle important cleanup) won't be called.

```cpp
// Without a virtual destructor:
class Base {
public:
    // some virtual methods
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() {
        // Important cleanup for Derived class
    }
};

int main(){
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj;  // Problem: Only the Base class destructor will be called
}
```

If the destructor in Base is not virtual, only the Base destructor gets called when deleting obj, causing potential resource leaks because the Derived class's destructor isn't executed.

- Always make the base class destructor **virtual** if you plan to delete derived class objects through a base class pointer.
- If you don’t want a class to be deleted through a base pointer, you can make the destructor **protected** and **non-virtual**.

### Simple Rule:
- **Virtual destructors** are needed for **polymorphic base classes** to ensure proper resource cleanup when deleting objects.

## Explain the concept of Message Passing.

Message passing is a fundamental concept in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** where objects communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. This is typically achieved through **method calls**.

### 🛠️ How It Works?
1. **Sender Object**: Calls a method on another object.
2. **Receiver Object**: Receives the method call and processes it.
3. **Encapsulation**: The internal state of objects remains hidden, ensuring data integrity.

```cpp
class Student {
public:
    void displayMessage() {
        cout << "Hello! I am a student." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;  // Creating an object
    s1.displayMessage();  // Message passing (method call)
}
```

### Why is Message Passing Important?
- **Encapsulation** – Hides internal implementation details.
- **Modularity** – Objects interact through well-defined interfaces.
- **Flexibility** – Objects can be modified without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Reusability** – Promotes code reuse by designing loosely coupled objects.

## Explain the concept of a V-Table and what problem it solved?

A **V-Table (Virtual Table)** is a mechanism used by C++ to implement **runtime polymorphism**. It is a table (array) of function pointers that helps resolve **which function to call** when a virtual function is invoked.

### 🔥 Why is V-Table Needed?
Before V-Tables, function calls were **resolved at compile-time (static binding)**.
However, when **virtual functions** were introduced, function calls needed to be determined **at runtime (dynamic binding)**.

V-Tables **solve this problem** by storing pointers to the correct function **at runtime**, allowing polymorphism to work.

### 🏗️ How Does V-Table Work?
1️⃣ Each class with virtual functions gets a **V-Table**.
2️⃣ The V-Table stores **pointers to virtual functions** of that class.
3️⃣ Each object of such a class has a hidden pointer called **vptr (Virtual Pointer)** that points to the class's V-Table.
4️⃣ When a virtual function is called, the **vptr** is used to look up the function in the **V-Table**, ensuring the correct function is executed.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base class show() called\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived class show() called\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* b = new Derived();
    b->show();  // Calls Derived::show() due to V-Table mechanism
    delete b;
}
```

### 🎨 Visual Representation
```
+---------------------+
|  V-Table (Base)     |  <---- Base class has a virtual function table
|---------------------|
|  show() → Base::show()  |
+---------------------+

+---------------------+
|  V-Table (Derived)  |  <---- Derived class overrides show()
|---------------------|
|  show() → Derived::show() |
+---------------------+

+-------------------+       +---------------------+
| Object of Derived | ----->|  V-Table (Derived)  |
| (has vptr)       |       |  show() → Derived::show() |
+-------------------+       +---------------------+
```

### 🎯 Step-by-Step Execution of V-Table in C++

#### Execution Process:
1️⃣ `Base* b = new Derived();`
   - A **Derived object** is created but accessed via a **Base class pointer**.
2️⃣ The **vptr** of `b` points to the **V-Table of Derived class**.
3️⃣ `b->show();` is called.
4️⃣ The **vptr** checks the **V-Table** and resolves `show()` to `Derived::show()`.
5️⃣ **Output:**
    `Derived class show() called`

- **V-Table enables runtime polymorphism.**
- **Each class with virtual functions has a V-Table.**
- **Each object has a hidden `vptr` pointing to the class's V-Table.**
- **Ensures the correct function is called at runtime, even with base class pointers.**

## What does it mean by Simulating a final class?

A **final class** is a class that **cannot be inherited**. While C++11 introduced the `final` keyword, earlier versions required a workaround to achieve the same behavior.

### How to Simulate a Final Class?
To **simulate a final class** in pre-C++11, you can:
1️⃣ Declare the **constructor as private** and provide a **friend factory function**.
2️⃣ Make the **base class destructor private** and provide a public static method to create instances.

```cpp
// Preventing Inheritance Manually
class FinalBase {
private:
    // Private constructor prevents direct instantiation
    FinalBase() {}

    // Private destructor prevents subclassing
    ~FinalBase() {}

public:
    // Factory method to create instances
    static FinalBase* create() {
        return new FinalBase();
    }

    // Public method
    void show() { cout << "FinalBase class function\n"; }
};

// ❌ This will cause a compilation error
class Derived : public FinalBase {};
```

## What is an Abstract Class? What is the major thing they don't allow us to do?

An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated** and serves as a **blueprint** for derived classes. It is used to enforce a specific interface that all child classes must implement.

- Contains **at least one pure virtual function** (`= 0`).
- Cannot be used to create objects directly.
- Derived classes must **override all pure virtual functions** to become concrete.

### 🛑 What Does an Abstract Class NOT Allow?
❌ **Cannot create objects of an abstract class.**
❌ **Forces derived classes to implement required functionality.**

---

```cpp
// Defining an Abstract Class
class AbstractShape {
public:
    // Pure virtual function (must be overridden)
    virtual void draw() = 0;

    // Normal function with implementation
    void info() { cout << "This is a shape.\n"; }
};

class Circle : public AbstractShape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing a Circle\n"; }
};

int main() {
    // AbstractShape shape; ❌ ERROR: Cannot instantiate an abstract class

    Circle c;
    c.draw(); // ✅ Output: Drawing a Circle
    c.info(); // ✅ Output: This is a shape.
}
```

- Used to **enforce common behavior** across multiple classes.
- **Pure virtual functions** make it mandatory for derived classes to implement them.
- **Cannot create objects of an abstract class.**

## What is the Difference between Abstract Class vs Normal Class vs Concrete Class?

| Feature            | Abstract Class                         | Normal Class                  | Concrete Class                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Definition**     | A class with at least one pure virtual function. | A general class with no pure virtual functions. | A class that fully implements all inherited abstract methods. |
| **Object Creation** | ❌ Cannot create objects directly. | ✅ Can create objects. | ✅ Can create objects. |
| **Purpose**       | Acts as a blueprint for derived classes. | Represents a general class with normal members. | Implements all functionality needed to create instances. |
| **Contains Pure Virtual Functions?** | ✅ Yes, at least one. | ❌ No. | ❌ No. |
| **Must Be Inherited?** | ✅ Yes, to be useful. | ❌ No, but can be inherited. | ❌ No, but can be inherited. |
| **Example** | `class Shape { virtual void draw() = 0; };` | `class Animal { void speak(); };` | `class Dog : public Animal { void speak() override; };` |

```cpp
// Abstract Class
class AbstractClass {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

// Normal Class
class NormalClass {
public:
    void display() { cout << "This is a normal class.\n"; }
};

// Concrete Class (Inheriting Abstract Class)
class ConcreteClass : public AbstractClass {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "This is a concrete class.\n"; }
};

int main() {
    // ❌ AbstractClass obj;  // ERROR: Cannot instantiate abstract class
    NormalClass normal;
    ConcreteClass concrete;

    normal.display();  // ✅ Output: This is a normal class.
    concrete.show();   // ✅ Output: This is a concrete class.
}
```

- **Abstract Class** → Defines an interface, cannot instantiate objects.
- **Normal Class** → A standard class, can be instantiated.
- **Concrete Class** → Fully implements an abstract class, can be instantiated.

## What is an Interface?

An **interface** is a class that contains only **pure virtual functions** (`= 0`) and no data members. It defines a contract that derived classes must follow.

- **Only pure virtual functions** (no implementation).
- **Cannot create objects** of an interface.
- **Must be inherited** by derived classes.
- **Forces derived classes to implement all functions**.

```cpp
// Interface (Pure Abstract Class)
class IShape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual ~IShape() {}     // Virtual destructor (best practice)
};

// Concrete Class (Implements Interface)
class Circle : public IShape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing a Circle\n"; }
};

// Concrete Class (Implements Interface)
class Rectangle : public IShape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing a Rectangle\n"; }
};

int main() {
    IShape* shape1 = new Circle();
    IShape* shape2 = new Rectangle();

    shape1->draw();  // ✅ Output: Drawing a Circle
    shape2->draw();  // ✅ Output: Drawing a Rectangle

    delete shape1;
    delete shape2;
}
```

### 🆚 Interface vs Abstract Class

| Feature                 | Interface (Pure Abstract Class) | Abstract Class |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| **Contains Data Members?**  | ❌ No  | ✅ Yes  |
| **Function Implementation?** | ❌ No (Only pure virtual functions) | ✅ Can have implemented functions |
| **Multiple Inheritance?**    | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Object Creation?**         | ❌ No  | ❌ No  |

### ✅ When to Use an Interface?
- When you **only** want to enforce a structure (no common functionality).
- When you need **multiple inheritance** without ambiguity.
- When defining a **strict contract** that all derived classes must follow.

## Can you call the base class method without creating an instance?

Yes, you can call a base class method without instantiating it if:

1️⃣ **It is a static method**
   - Static methods belong to the class itself, not to an instance.
   ```cpp
   class Base {
   public:
       static void show() {
           cout << "Base class static method\n";
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Base::show(); // ✅ Called without an instance
   }
   ```

2️⃣ **The base class is inherited by a subclass**
    - If a method is not private, a derived class can call it.
    ```cpp
    class Base {
        public:
            void show() {
                cout << "Base class method\n";
            }
        };

    class Derived : public Base {};

    int main() {
        Derived d;
        d.show(); // ✅ Base method called via derived class
    }
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## Can an abstract class have implemented methods?

Yes, an **abstract class** can have implemented methods.

- An abstract class can have both **pure virtual functions** and **regular functions** with implementation.
- It cannot be instantiated directly.
- Derived classes can **override** the virtual methods or use the implemented ones.

```cpp
class AbstractBase {
public:
    // Pure virtual function (must be overridden)
    virtual void pureVirtualFunc() = 0;

    // Regular function with implementation
    void implementedFunc() {
        cout << "Implemented method in AbstractBase\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public AbstractBase {
public:
    void pureVirtualFunc() override {
        cout << "Overridden pure virtual function in Derived\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.pureVirtualFunc();   // ✅ Calls overridden function
    obj.implementedFunc();   // ✅ Calls implemented method in base class
}
```

- Abstract classes can have implemented methods.
- Only pure virtual functions need to be overridden in derived classes.
- Useful for providing default behavior while enforcing required implementations.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What happens if we do not implement all methods of an interface in a class?

If a class does not implement all the methods of an **interface (pure abstract class)**, then:

1️⃣ The class itself becomes **abstract** and cannot be instantiated.
2️⃣ The class must be marked as **abstract** or implement the missing methods in a derived class.
3️⃣ If an object of such a class is created, the compiler will throw an **error**.

```cpp
// Missing Implementation Causes an Error

// Interface (pure abstract class)
class Interface {
public:
    virtual void method1() = 0;
    virtual void method2() = 0;
};

class IncompleteClass : public Interface {
public:
    void method1() override {
        cout << "Implemented method1\n";
    }
    // ❌ method2() is NOT implemented, making this class abstract
};

int main() {
    // ❌ Error: Cannot instantiate an abstract class
    IncompleteClass obj;
    obj.method1();
}
```

- **Fix:** Implement method2() in IncompleteClass, or make IncompleteClass abstract.

```cpp
// Proper Implementation to Avoid Errors
class CompleteClass : public Interface {
public:
    void method1() override {
        cout << "Implemented method1\n";
    }
    void method2() override {
        cout << "Implemented method2\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    CompleteClass obj;
    obj.method1();  // ✅ No error
    obj.method2();
}
```

- If all methods are not implemented, the class remains abstract.
- You must implement all methods to instantiate the class.
- Leaving methods unimplemented forces subclasses to complete the implementation.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## How to avoid the implementation of an abstract function?

In C++, you can avoid implementing an **abstract function** in a derived class using the following approaches:

### ✅ 1. Make the Derived Class Abstract
If a derived class does **not** implement all pure virtual functions, it remains **abstract** and cannot be instantiated.

```cpp
// Abstract class
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

// Derived class remains abstract (doesn't implement show)
class Derived : public Base {
    // No implementation of show()
};

int main() {
    // ❌ Error: Cannot instantiate an abstract class
    Derived d;
}
```

- **Fix**: If you want to use this derived class, you must implement `show()`.

### ✅ 2. Provide Implementation in a Further Derived Class

- You can skip implementing an abstract function in the immediate derived class and implement it later in another subclass.

```cpp
class Derived : public Base {
    // ❌ No implementation of show()
};

class FurtherDerived : public Derived {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "show() implemented in FurtherDerived\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    FurtherDerived obj;
    obj.show(); // ✅ Works fine
}
```

- The method is finally implemented in `FurtherDerived`, so it can be instantiated.

### ✅ 3. Use Default Implementation in Base Class

- Instead of forcing every subclass to implement the function, provide a default implementation in the base class.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Default show() in Base\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
    // No need to implement show(), uses Base class version
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.show(); // ✅ Uses Base class implementation
}
```

- The derived class inherits the default behavior and does not need to override the function.

- Keep the derived class abstract if you don’t want to implement the function.
- Implement it in a further derived class instead.
- Provide a default implementation in the base class.

## How many instances can be created for an abstract class? Explain why.

❌ Zero! You **cannot** instantiate an abstract class in C++.

### 🤔 Why?
An **abstract class** contains **at least one pure virtual function** (`= 0`). Since the function lacks an implementation in the base class, the compiler prevents object creation to **enforce proper implementation in derived classes**.

### 🛑 Attempting to Instantiate an Abstract Class
```cpp
class AbstractBase {
public:
    virtual void show() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

int main() {
    AbstractBase obj; // ❌ Compilation Error
}
```

- **Error:** You cannot create an object of an abstract class.

### ✅ Instantiating Derived Classes
- If a **derived class** implements all pure virtual functions, you can create objects of that class.

```cpp
class Derived : public AbstractBase {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "show() implemented in Derived class\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj; // ✅ Works fine
    obj.show();
}
```

- Since `Derived` implements `show()`, it is no longer abstract.

### ✅ Using Pointers or References to Abstract Classes
- Although you **cannot instantiate** an abstract class, you can create pointers or references to it and use polymorphism.

```cpp
AbstractBase* ptr = new Derived(); // ✅ Allowed
ptr->show();
delete ptr;
```

- The base class pointer can hold an object of the derived class.

- **Abstract classes** cannot be instantiated.
- **They serve as blueprints for derived classes.**
- Objects can only be created from **non-abstract derived classes**.
- **Polymorphism** is achieved using base class pointers or references.

## What is Operator Overloading? What main problem does it solve?

Operator overloading allows you to define **custom behavior** for operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.) for **user-defined classes**.

### 🎯 Why Do We Need It?
By default, operators work only with **primitive data types**. Operator overloading helps in:
- **Enhancing code readability** by using natural expressions.
- **Supporting user-defined types** (e.g., vectors, matrices, complex numbers).
- **Implementing custom logic** for object operations.

```cpp
// Overloading `+` for a `Complex` Class

class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;

    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overloading the '+' operator
    Complex operator+(const Complex& obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }

    void display() {
        cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(2, 3), c2(4, 5);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // Calls overloaded '+' operator
    c3.display();  // Output: 6 + 8i
}
```

### ✅ Benefits of Operator Overloading:
- Makes code cleaner and more intuitive
- Supports mathematical operations on objects
- Enables custom behavior for operators

### 🚨 Things to Keep in Mind:
- Not all operators can be overloaded (e.g., ::, .*, sizeof, typeid).
- Overloaded operators should follow the expected behavior to avoid confusion.
- Friend functions or member functions can be used for overloading.

## What are templates? Explain the different types of templates with examples.

Templates are a **powerful feature** in C++ that allows writing **generic and reusable** code.
They enable defining **functions and classes** that work with **any data type** without specifying the exact type in advance.

- **Type Independence**: Works with multiple data types.
- **Code Reusability**: Eliminates redundant code.
- **Flexibility**: Can handle different data types with the same function/class.

### 📌 Types of Templates:
#### 1️⃣ **Function Template**
Function templates allow creating functions that work with **any data type**.

```cpp
// Function template
template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << add(5, 10) << endl;      // Works with int
    cout << add(3.5, 2.5) << endl;  // Works with double
}
```

#### **2️⃣ Class Template**
Class templates allow creating generic classes that work with different data types.

```cpp
// Class template
template <typename T>
class Box {
private:
    T value;
public:
    Box(T v) : value(v) {}
    void show() { cout << "Value: " << value << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Box<int> intBox(10);
    Box<double> doubleBox(5.5);

    intBox.show();    // Works with int
    doubleBox.show(); // Works with double
}
```

#### 3️⃣ **Template Specialization**
Template specialization allows creating custom implementations for specific data types.

##### Full Specialization
- Defines a specific implementation for a particular type.
```cpp
// Generic template
template <typename T>
class Printer {
public:
    static void print(T value) {
        cout << "Generic: " << value << endl;
    }
};

// Full specialization for char type
template <>
class Printer<char> {
public:
    static void print(char value) {
        cout << "Character: " << value << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Printer<int>::print(42);   // Uses generic template
    Printer<char>::print('A'); // Uses specialized template
}
```

##### Partial Specialization
- Specializes a subset of template parameters, leaving others generic.

```cpp
// Generic template
template <typename T1, typename T2>
class Pair {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Generic Pair" << endl; }
};

// Partial specialization for same type parameters
template <typename T>
class Pair<T, T> {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Specialized Pair with same types" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Pair<int, double> p1;
    p1.show(); // Generic version

    Pair<int, int> p2;
    p2.show(); // Specialized version
}
```

- **Function Templates** → Used for generic functions.
- **Class Templates** → Used for generic classes.
- **Full Specialization** → Provides a specific implementation for a particular type.
- **Partial Specialization** → Specializes some template parameters while keeping others generic.

## What Are Threads?

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution in a process.
Multithreading allows a program to **run multiple tasks in parallel**, improving performance.

- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Efficient CPU Usage**: Utilizes multiple cores effectively.
- **Faster Performance**: Reduces execution time for heavy tasks.

### 📌 Creating a Thread in C++
Using the **`<thread>`** library to create and run threads.

#### 📌 Simple Multithreading Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

using namespace std;

// Function to be executed by the thread
void printMessage() {
    cout << "Hello from the thread!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    thread t(printMessage); // Create a thread
    t.join();               // Wait for the thread to finish

    cout << "Hello from main!" << endl;
}
```
✅ **Output:**
```
Hello from the thread!
Hello from main!
```

#### 📌 Thread Management

##### **Joining a Thread (`join()`)**
- Ensures the main thread **waits** for a thread to complete.
- Prevents unexpected behavior due to early termination.

```cpp
t.join(); // Waits for thread 't' to finish
```

##### **Detaching a Thread (`detach()`)**
- Runs the thread **independently**.
- The main thread **does not wait** for completion.

```cpp
t.detach(); // Runs in the background
```

⚠ **Caution:** Detached threads run independently, so the main function **must not exit before they finish**.

#### 📌 Passing Arguments to a Thread

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

using namespace std;

void greet(string name) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    thread t(greet, "Ahad"); // Passing argument to thread
    t.join(); // Wait for completion
}
```
✅ **Output:**
```
Hello, Ahad!
```
---

#### 📌 Synchronization with `mutex`
Multiple threads **accessing shared resources** can cause **data inconsistency**.

- Using a **mutex** (mutual exclusion) helps prevent race conditions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

using namespace std;

mutex mtx; // Declare a mutex

void printMessage(string msg) {
    mtx.lock(); // Lock the resource
    cout << msg << endl;
    mtx.unlock(); // Unlock after use
}

int main() {
    thread t1(printMessage, "Hello from Thread 1");
    thread t2(printMessage, "Hello from Thread 2");

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
}
```
✅ **Output (Safe Execution):**
```
Hello from Thread 1
Hello from Thread 2
```

- **Threads** → Enable parallel execution for improved performance.
- **`join()`** → Ensures main thread waits for the thread to finish.
- **`detach()`** → Runs thread in background (use with caution).
- **`mutex`** → Prevents **race conditions** when using shared data.

## What is an Exception?

Exceptions provide a way to handle errors and other exceptional conditions that occur
during the execution of a program. They help you manage unexpected situations without
using error codes and improve the robustness and readability of your code.

### Basics of Exception:

#### Throwing Exception:
Use the `throw` keyword to signal that an error or exceptional condition has occurred.

```cpp
void divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        throw "Division by zero error!";
    }
    cout << "Result: " << a / b << endl;
}

int main() {
    try {
        divide(10, 0);
    } catch (const char* e) {
        cout << "Exception caught: " << e << endl;
    }
}
```

### Exception Handling in C++:
Exception handling in C++ provides a way to handle runtime errors, such as divide by zero or accessing an out-of-bounds array element. It allows the program to continue execution instead of terminating abruptly. It is done by using `try-catch` blocks, and the `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception when an error occurs.

### Benefits of Exception Handling:
- Makes the code more **robust** and **maintainable**.
- Separates **error handling code** from the normal execution flow.
- Prevents program crashes by handling unexpected situations properly.


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## What is the Difference between Error vs Exception?

| Feature          | Error | Exception |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| Definition      | An error is a serious issue that a program cannot handle. | An exception is an issue that can be handled using try-catch blocks. |
| Occurrence      | Errors usually occur at compile-time or due to system-level failures. | Exceptions typically occur at runtime due to logical issues. |
| Recoverability  | Errors are mostly unrecoverable and require program termination. | Exceptions can be caught and handled to continue program execution. |
| Examples       | Stack overflow, Out of memory, Syntax errors. | Null pointer access, Division by zero, Invalid input format. |
| Handling Mechanism | Errors are not meant to be caught using try-catch. | Exceptions are handled using try, catch, and throw mechanisms. |
| Impact         | Generally leads to program crash or abnormal termination. | Allows controlled flow even after an exceptional situation. |

- Errors are severe and should be avoided by writing robust code.
- Exceptions are part of normal program flow and should be handled properly.
- Exception handling ensures program stability and better error management.

## What are Objects Relations?

In OOP, objects interact in different ways. The five main types of relationships are:

### **1. Association**
- **Definition:** A general relationship where one object uses another.
- **Example:** A **Professor** teaches **Students**.

### **2. Aggregation (Has-A Relationship)**
- **Definition:** A weak relationship where an object can exist independently of another.
- **Example:** A **Library** has multiple **Books**, but books can exist outside the library.

### **3. Composition (Strong Has-A Relationship)**
- **Definition:** A strong relationship where an object depends on another for its existence.
- **Example:** A **Human** has a **Heart**; the heart cannot exist without the human.

### **4. Inheritance (Is-A Relationship)**
- **Definition:** One class derives from another, inheriting its properties and behavior.
- **Example:** A **Car** is a **Vehicle**.

### **5. Dependency**
- **Definition:** One class depends on another but does not own it.
- **Example:** A **Doctor** prescribes **Medicine**, but the doctor doesn’t own the medicine.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is Association?

**Association** is a simple structural connection between classes where objects interact but have **independent lifecycles**.

### Alternative Definition:
- Association is a simple structural connection or relationship between two or more objects where all objects have their own lifecycle, and there is no strict ownership.

- **Example:** Multiple **Patients** can associate with multiple **Doctors**, but neither owns the other.

```cpp
class Doctor {
public:
    string name;
    Doctor(string n) : name(n) {}

    void treat() {
        cout << name << " is treating a patient." << endl;
    }
};

class Patient {
public:
    string name;
    Patient(string n) : name(n) {}

    void consult(Doctor &doc) {
        cout << name << " is consulting " << doc.name << "." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Doctor doc("Dr. Abdul Samad");
    Patient pat("Abdullah Salam");

    pat.consult(doc);
    doc.treat();
}
```
- The `doctor` and `patient` exist independently, making this a simple association.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is Aggregation (Weak Relationship)?

**Aggregation** is a specialized form of association where objects have their own lifecycle, but there is an ownership relationship like parent and child.
- The child object cannot belong to another parent at the same time.

**Example:**
- A single Employee can belong to multiple Companies, but deleting a company does not delete the employee.
`OR`
- A company has **multiple employees**, but if the company is deleted, the employees still exist.

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    string name;
    Employee(string n) : name(n) {}

    void show() {
        cout << "Employee: " << name << endl;
    }
};

class Company {
public:
    string companyName;
    vector<Employee*> employees;  // Aggregation: Employees exist independently

    Company(string name) : companyName(name) {}

    void addEmployee(Employee* emp) {
        employees.push_back(emp);
    }

    void showEmployees() {
        cout << companyName << " has employees: " << endl;
        for (auto emp : employees) {
            emp->show();
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Employee e1("John"), e2("Alice");
    Company c1("Tech Corp");
    c1.addEmployee(&e1);
    c1.addEmployee(&e2);
    c1.showEmployees();
}
```

- Deleting `c1` (Company) does not delete employees `(e1, e2)`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is Composition (Strong Relationship)?

**Composition** is a stronger form of aggregation where the child object cannot exist without the parent. If the parent is deleted, the child is also deleted.

### Alternative Definition:
- Composition is a strong form of aggregation, where the child object depends on the parent for its lifetime.

**Example:**
- A human has a heart; the heart cannot exist without the human.
`OR`
- A Person has a Heart; if the person is deleted, the heart must also be deleted.

```cpp
class Heart {
public:
    Heart() {
        cout << "Heart Created!" << endl;
    }
    ~Heart() {
        cout << "Heart Destroyed!" << endl;
    }
};

class Person {
private:
    Heart heart;  // Composition: Heart belongs to Person

public:
    Person() {
        cout << "Person Created!" << endl;
    }
    ~Person() {
        cout << "Person Destroyed!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person p1;
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

| Aspect          | Association                          | Aggregation (Weak Has-A)         | Composition (Strong Has-A) |
|----------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Relationship between objects with independent lifecycles. | Parent owns child, but child can exist independently. | Parent owns child, and child depends on parent. |
| **Example**     | A doctor and a patient interact but don’t depend on each other. | A company has employees, but employees can exist elsewhere. | A person has a heart, and the heart cannot exist without the person. |
| **Object Lifecycle** | Objects are independent. | Parent and child can exist separately. | Child’s lifecycle is tied to the parent. |
| **Deletion Impact** | No effect on the other object. | Deleting parent does not delete child. | Deleting parent deletes child. |

- Use **Association** when objects interact without ownership.
- Use **Aggregation** when a parent can have multiple children, but children exist independently.
- Use **Composition** when the child's lifecycle is tied to the parent.

---

## What is a Has-a Relationship?

A **Has-a Relationship** is also known as **composition or aggregation**. It represents an object containing another object as part of its attributes. This relationship helps in code reusability and is often implemented using **instance variables**.

```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() {
        cout << "Engine starting..." << endl;
    }
};

class Car {
private:
    Engine engine; // Has-a Relationship
public:
    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        cout << "Car started!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.startCar();
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is an Is-a Relationship?

An **Is-a Relationship** represents **inheritance** in Object-Oriented Programming. It means that one class is a specialized version of another class, allowing it to inherit properties and behaviors.

```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    void move() {
        cout << "Vehicle is moving..." << endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle { // Is-a Relationship
public:
    void honk() {
        cout << "Car horn: Beep Beep!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.move();
    myCar.honk();
}
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

## What is the Difference between Is-a relationship and Has-a relationship (Aggregation vs. Composition)? Implement examples of each.

| Aspect             | Is-a Relationship (Inheritance) | Has-a Relationship (Composition/Aggregation) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | One class derives from another, inheriting behavior. | One class contains another class as a member variable. |
| **Example**       | A **Car** is a **Vehicle**. | A **Car** has an **Engine**. |
| **Code Reuse**    | Code is reused via inheritance. | Code is reused via object composition. |
| **Flexibility**   | Less flexible, tightly coupled. | More flexible, loosely coupled. |
| **Modification**  | Changes in the base class affect derived classes. | Changes in the contained class do not affect the container. |

```cpp
// Is-a Relationship (Inheritance)
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "This animal is eating." << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal { // Is-a Relationship
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog is barking." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog myDog;
    myDog.eat();
    myDog.bark();
}
```

```cpp
// Has-a Relationship (Composition)
class Battery {
public:
    void charge() {
        cout << "Battery is charging..." << endl;
    }
};

class Phone {
private:
    Battery battery; // Has-a Relationship
public:
    void chargePhone() {
        battery.charge();
        cout << "Phone is charging!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Phone myPhone;
    myPhone.chargePhone();
}
```

- **Use Inheritance (Is-a) when one class is a specialized type of another.**
- **Use Composition/Aggregation (Has-a) when one class contains another as a part.**

## What is the Difference between Generalization, Aggregation, Composition and Association?

| Aspect          | Generalization (Is-A) | Association | Aggregation (Weak Has-A) | Composition (Strong Has-A) |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Definition** | A relationship where a subclass inherits from a superclass. | A general relationship where objects interact. | A parent-child relationship where the child can exist independently. | A parent-child relationship where the child depends on the parent. |
| **Example** | A `Car` is a `Vehicle`. | A `Doctor` treats a `Patient`. | A `Library` has `Books`, but books can exist outside the library. | A `Person` has a `Heart`, and the heart cannot exist without the person. |
| **Object Lifecycle** | Subclass and superclass have independent lifecycles. | Objects are independent. | Parent and child can exist separately. | Child's lifecycle is tied to the parent. |
| **Deletion Impact** | Deleting the superclass does not delete the subclass. | No effect on the other object. | Deleting the parent does not delete the child. | Deleting the parent deletes the child. |
| **Code Reusability** | Promotes reuse via inheritance. | No direct code reuse. | Objects can be shared across different parents. | High encapsulation and dependency. |

#### **Generalization (Is-A Relationship - Inheritance)**
```cpp
class Vehicle {  // Superclass
public:
    void startEngine() {
        cout << "Engine started!" << endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {  // Subclass inheriting from Vehicle
public:
    void honk() {
        cout << "Car is honking!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.startEngine(); // Inherited from Vehicle
    myCar.honk();        // Specific to Car
}
```

#### **Association**
```cpp
class Doctor {
public:
    void treatPatient() {
        cout << "Doctor is treating a patient." << endl;
    }
};

class Patient {
public:
    void visitDoctor(Doctor& doc) {
        doc.treatPatient();
    }
};

int main() {
    Doctor doc;
    Patient pat;
    pat.visitDoctor(doc); // Objects interact but are independent
}
```

#### **Aggregation (Weak Has-A Relationship)**
```cpp
class Book {
public:
    string title;
    Book(string t) : title(t) {}
    void showTitle() { cout << "Book: " << title << endl; }
};

class Library {
public:
    Book* book; // Aggregation: Book can exist outside Library
    Library(Book* b) : book(b) {}
    void showLibraryBook() { book->showTitle(); }
};

int main() {
    Book myBook("C++ Programming");
    Library lib(&myBook);
    lib.showLibraryBook(); // Book exists independently of Library
}
```

#### **Composition (Strong Has-A Relationship)**
```cpp
class Heart {
public:
    Heart() { cout << "Heart Created" << endl; }
    ~Heart() { cout << "Heart Destroyed" << endl; }
};

class Person {
private:
    Heart heart; // Composition: Heart is part of Person and cannot exist without it
public:
    Person() { cout << "Person Created" << endl; }
    ~Person() { cout << "Person Destroyed" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Person p;
}
```

- **Generalization** (Is-A) is used for inheritance and code reuse.
- **Association** defines relationships without ownership.
- **Aggregation** allows objects to be associated but independent.
- **Composition** ensures strong ownership and lifecycle dependency.

## Explain the concept of Coupling and Cohesion?

### **1. What is Coupling?**
**Coupling** refers to the degree of dependency between two classes or modules in a program. It determines how much one module relies on another.

#### **Types of Coupling:**
1. **High Coupling (Tightly Coupled)**
   - When modules/classes are heavily dependent on each other.
   - Difficult to modify, test, or reuse.

2. **Low Coupling (Loosely Coupled)**
   - When modules/classes have minimal dependencies.
   - Easier to modify, test, and scale.

#### **Real-World Example of Coupling:**
🔴 **High Coupling:** A **car engine** is tightly coupled with the **car chassis**. If the chassis changes, the engine must be redesigned.
🟢 **Low Coupling:** A **TV remote** and a **TV** communicate through infrared but can work independently.

```cpp
// High Coupling
class Engine {
public:
    void start() {
        cout << "Engine started!" << endl;
    }
};

class Car {
    Engine engine; // Direct dependency (Tightly Coupled)
public:
    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.startCar();
}
```

- 🔴 **Problem:** The `Car` class is tightly coupled with `Engine`, meaning any changes to `Engine` will affect `Car`.

```cpp
// Low Coupling using Dependency Injection
class Engine {
public:
    void start() {
        cout << "Engine started!" << endl;
    }
};

class Car {
    Engine* engine; // Loose coupling through pointer
public:
    Car(Engine* eng) : engine(eng) {}

    void startCar() {
        engine->start();
    }
};

int main() {
    Engine myEngine;
    Car myCar(&myEngine); // Injecting Engine instance
    myCar.startCar();
}
```

### **2. What is Cohesion?**
Cohesion refers to how well the elements of a module/class work together to achieve a single purpose.

#### **Types of Cohesion:**
🔴 1. **Low Cohesion**
- A module/class performs multiple unrelated tasks.
- Hard to maintain and understand.

🟢 2. **High Cohesion**
- A module/class focuses on a single well-defined task.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.

#### **Real-World Example of Cohesion:**
- 🔴 **Low Cohesion:** A **Swiss army knife** does multiple unrelated tasks (cutting, opening bottles, filing nails).
- 🟢 **High Cohesion:** A **knife** is designed only for cutting.

```cpp
// Low Cohesion
class Utility {
public:
    void printMessage() {
        cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    }

    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    void saveToFile() {
        cout << "Data saved to file!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Utility util;
    util.printMessage();
    cout << "Sum: " << util.add(3, 5) << endl;
    util.saveToFile();
}
```

- 🔴 **Problem:** The `Utility` class does unrelated tasks (printing, adding, file handling). This is low cohesion.

```cpp
// High Cohesion
lass Logger {
public:
    void printMessage() {
        cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    }
};

class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

class FileManager {
public:
    void saveToFile() {
        cout << "Data saved to file!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Logger logger;
    Calculator calc;
    FileManager fileManager;

    logger.printMessage();
    cout << "Sum: " << calc.add(3, 5) << endl;
    fileManager.saveToFile();
}
```

- 🟢 **Benefit:** Each class is focused owa?n a single responsibility, making the code more maintainable and readable.

## What problems do OOP concepts like Class, Object, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and other related concepts solve?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduces various concepts to address common software development challenges. These concepts make the code more reusable, maintainable, scalable, and modular. Below are the problems solved by each OOP principle:

### 1. Class & Object

**Problem Occurred:**
- Code lacked structure, making it hard to manage.
- Repeating the same logic across different parts of the program.
- No logical grouping of related data and functions.

**Problem Solved:**
- Helps organize code efficiently by grouping data and functions into logical units.
- Enables code reusability by creating multiple objects from a single class.
- Avoids redundant code by defining once and using it multiple times.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Class:** `Car` (Attributes: brand, model, color | Methods: start(), stop())
- **Objects:** `Car car1 = new Car(); Car car2 = new Car();`

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    string model;
    void start() {
        cout << "Car started";
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;
    car1.brand = "Toyota";
    car1.model = "Corolla";
    car1.start();
}
```

### 2. Encapsulation

**Problem Occurred:**
- Direct access to data led to accidental modification.
- No controlled way to access or modify object properties.

**Problem Solved:**
- Restricts direct access to data, preventing accidental modification.
- Protects object integrity by allowing controlled access through methods (getters & setters).
- Increases security by hiding implementation details from the user.

**Real-World Example:**
A `BankAccount` class has a `balance` attribute that is private. Users can only modify it through `deposit()` or `withdraw()` methods.

```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;
public:
    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    double getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

### 3. Abstraction

**Problem Occurred:**
- Users needed to understand too many internal details.
- Increased complexity when interacting with objects.

**Problem Solved:**
- Hides unnecessary details and exposes only essential features.
- Simplifies complex systems by showing only the required functionalities.
- Reduces system complexity and increases efficiency.

**Real-World Example:**
- In a `PaymentGateway` class, the user calls `processPayment()`, but the implementation details of different payment methods are hidden.
- Using a **Car**: Users only interact with the **steering and pedals** without worrying about the engine internals.
```cpp
class Car {
public:
    void drive() { cout << "Car is moving"; }
};
```

### 4. Inheritance

**Problem Occurred:**
- Repeated code in multiple classes.
- Difficulty in maintaining similar functionalities in multiple places.

**Problem Solved:**
- Avoids code duplication by allowing a derived class to reuse code from a base class.
- Improves maintainability by centralizing common logic in a base class.

**Real-World Example:**
A `Vehicle` class has common properties like `speed`, `color`, and `fuelCapacity`. `Car` and `Bike` inherit these properties instead of redefining them.

```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    int speed;
    void accelerate() { speed += 10; }
};
class Car : public Vehicle {
};
```

### 5. Polymorphism

**Problem Occurred:**
- Functions could not behave differently based on input types.
- No flexibility to override existing behavior.

**Problem Solved:**
- Allows one interface to be used for different types.
- Reduces dependencies by enabling flexible and reusable code.
- Makes code easier to extend and maintain.

### Types of Polymorphism:
- **Compile-time (Method Overloading):** Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
- **Runtime (Method Overriding):** The derived class provides a specific implementation of a method from the base class.

**Real-World Example:**
- A `Shape` class has a method `draw()`, but `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` implement it differently.
- Method overloading: `print(int)`, `print(float)`, `print(string)`.

- **Method Overloading** (Compile-time polymorphism):
```cpp
class Print {
public:
    void show(int i) { cout << "Integer: " << i; }
    void show(double d) { cout << "Double: " << d; }
};
```
- **Method Overriding** (Runtime polymorphism):
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks"; }
};
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override { cout << "Dog barks"; }
};
```

### 6. Composition

**Problem Occurred:**
- Overuse of inheritance led to unnecessary complexity.
- Tight coupling between unrelated objects.

**Problem Solved:**
- Promotes code reusability without unnecessary inheritance.
- Encourages modular design by making objects independent.

**Real-World Example:**
A `Car` class contains `Engine` and `Wheel` objects instead of inheriting from them.
```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() { cout << "Engine started"; }
};
class Car {
private:
    Engine engine;
public:
    void startCar() { engine.start(); }
};
```

### 7. Association, Aggregation, and Composition

**Problem Occurred:**
- No structured way to define relationships between objects.

**Problem Solved:**
- Helps in establishing relationships between different classes.
- Allows controlled access between objects, avoiding tight coupling.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Association:** A `Professor` teaches multiple `Students`.
- **Aggregation:** A `Library` has multiple `Books`, but books can exist without the library.
- **Composition:** A `Human` has a `Heart`, and the heart cannot exist independently.

### 8. Interfaces & Abstract Classes

**Problem Occurred:**
- No standard way to enforce method implementation across multiple classes.

**Problem Solved:**
- Enforces a contract for derived classes to follow.
- Enables multiple inheritance without ambiguity.
- Allows abstraction and flexibility in implementation.

**Real-World Example:**
- An `Animal` abstract class has an `eat()` method, and `Dog` and `Cat` must implement it.
- An `IShape` interface enforces the implementation of `draw()` for all shape classes.
```cpp
class IShape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;
};
class Circle : public IShape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Circle"; }
};
```

---

### Why OOP Concepts Are Essential?

✅ **Modularity:** Divides the program into small, manageable sections.
✅ **Code Reusability:** Reduces redundancy by reusing code through inheritance and composition.
✅ **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to update or modify code without affecting the entire system.
✅ **Security:** Encapsulation and abstraction prevent direct access to sensitive data.
✅ **Scalability:** Helps in developing large and complex software applications efficiently.
✅ **Extensibility:** Allows adding new features without modifying existing code.

## What problems arise without Static Binding, Dynamic Binding, Function Overloading, Function Overriding, and Inheritance? How do these concepts solve those problems and contribute to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

### 1. Static Binding (Early Binding)

**Problem Occurred:**
- Function calls were resolved at runtime, causing performance overhead.
- Developers needed a way to determine function execution at compile-time.

**Problem Solved:**
- Static binding resolves function calls at **compile-time**, improving performance.
- Reduces execution time by binding method addresses before the program runs.

**Real-World Example:**
```cpp
class Math {
public:
    void add(int a, int b) {
        cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Math obj;
    obj.add(5, 10); // Static Binding
}
```
- The function `add()` is determined at **compile-time**, making execution faster.

### 2. Dynamic Binding (Late Binding)

**Problem Occurred:**
- Sometimes, we don't know which function should be called until runtime.
- Static binding restricted flexibility for polymorphism.

**Problem Solved:**
- Dynamic binding defers function resolution to **runtime**, enabling **polymorphism**.
- It allows **method overriding**, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method from the base class.

**Real-World Example:**
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() { cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { cout << "Dog barks" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    a->sound(); // Dynamic Binding
}
```
- The function `sound()` is **resolved at runtime**, allowing polymorphism.

### 3. Function Overloading

**Problem Occurred:**
- Creating multiple functions with different names for similar operations made code **less readable** and **harder to maintain**.

**Problem Solved:**
- Function overloading allows multiple functions with the **same name but different parameters**.
- Increases **code readability** and **reduces redundancy**.

**Real-World Example:**
```cpp
class PrintData {
public:
    void print(int a) { cout << "Integer: " << a << endl; }
    void print(double a) { cout << "Double: " << a << endl; }
};

int main() {
    PrintData obj;
    obj.print(5);
    obj.print(3.14);
}
```
- The function `print()` is overloaded, making it more **intuitive and reusable**.

### 4. Function Overriding

**Problem Occurred:**
- Base class functions did not provide the required behavior in derived classes.
- Developers had to **reimplement** functions manually, leading to **redundant code**.

**Problem Solved:**
- Allows a subclass to **modify the behavior** of a base class method.
- Enables **runtime polymorphism** and promotes **code reusability**.

**Real-World Example:**
```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Parent Class" << endl; }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Child Class" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Parent* p = new Child();
    p->show(); // Function Overriding
}
```
- The method `show()` in **Child** overrides the base class implementation dynamically.

### 5. Inheritance Types in OOP

Inheritance helps reuse existing functionality and establish relationships between classes. There are **5 types** of inheritance:

#### a) Single Inheritance
**Problem Occurred:**
- Redundant code due to repeated implementations across similar classes.

**Problem Solved:**
- A subclass inherits from a single superclass.

```cpp
class Animal { public: void eat() { cout << "Eating" << endl; } };
class Dog : public Animal {};
int main() { Dog d; d.eat(); }
```

#### b) Multiple Inheritance
**Problem Occurred:**
- Classes needed to inherit properties from multiple base classes.
- Ambiguity issues when two parent classes have methods with the same name.

**Problem Solved:**
- Enables a child class to inherit from **multiple parent classes**.
- Ambiguity is resolved using **scope resolution**.

```cpp
class A { public: void show() { cout << "A" << endl; } };
class B { public: void show() { cout << "B" << endl; } };
class C : public A, public B {
public:
    void show() { A::show(); } // Resolving ambiguity
};
```

#### c) Multilevel Inheritance
**Problem Occurred:**
- Classes needed to inherit properties across multiple levels.

**Problem Solved:**
- A derived class acts as a base class for another class.

```cpp
class A { public: void show() { cout << "Class A"; } };
class B : public A {};
class C : public B {};
int main() { C obj; obj.show(); }
```

#### d) Hierarchical Inheritance
**Problem Occurred:**
- Multiple child classes needed to share a common base class.

**Problem Solved:**
- One parent class is inherited by multiple child classes.

```cpp
class Vehicle { public: void move() { cout << "Moving"; } };
class Car : public Vehicle {};
class Bike : public Vehicle {};
int main() { Car c; c.move(); }
```

#### e) Hybrid (Multiple + Multilevel)

**Problem Occurred:**
- Complex relationships required mixing multiple and multilevel inheritance.

**Problem Solved:**
- Combines different types of inheritance.

```cpp
class A { public: void show() { cout << "A"; } };
class B : public A {};
class C { public: void display() { cout << "C"; } };
class D : public B, public C {};
```
